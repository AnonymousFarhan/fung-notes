A sequence of characters from input device is called Input Stream . A sequence from computer to output device is called Output Stream . A stream is associated with file using open statement. A stream is disassociated from file using close statement. There following types of streams in C language: Text Stream Binary Stream Text Stream \u00b6 It is a sequence of characters. A certain character translation may occur in text stream. It can only be used for text data It is less efficient than binary stream. Binary Stream \u00b6 It is sequence of bytes. It has one-to-one relationship with external devices. No translation occurs in binary stream. It is more efficient than text stream. It can be used for different types of data. File access methods \u00b6 There are following methods to access a file: Sequential Access Method: It is used to access data is exact same sequence it is written. Random Access Method: It is used to access any data item directly without accessing the preceding data. EOL & EOF \u00b6 EOL: It is character used to define end of line (At end of every line). EOF: It is character used to define end of file (At end of file). Data file \u00b6 A collection of related records is called data file. It is a permanent storage of data. It can store any type of data. A type of data that stores data as printable and readable characters is called text file . Pointer \u00b6 A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable.

Solution: Note the word Earth and Heart are made from the same set of alphabets. In this case each alphabet corresponds to a specific number. In this case 2 for e, 3 for a and so on. So you'll use this knowledge to construct the new number from the given word ie. heart. In place of the number (23456) you can also be given another word. Then each alphabet will correspond to some other alphabet. Alphabets Shuffling \u00b6 Each alphabet is moved forward or backward to give the new word: This method might seem lengthy apparently but once you get used to it, you will solve the questions within few seconds. Consider a question. For example: If BAT stands for CDQ then PEN stands for? Solution: Step 1: Write down all the alphabets along with numbers from 1 to 26. Step 2: Convert the alphabets you have to numbers. i.e. B A T will be 2 1 20 And C D Q will be 3 4 17 Step 3: Find the difference between the two figures 3 \u2013 2 = 1 4 \u2013 1 = 3 17 \u2013 20 = -3 Step 4: Convert second word (PEN) into digits that will be 16 5 14 Step 5: Add the difference you got above. 16 + 1 = 17 5 + 3 = 8 14 + (-3) = 11 Step 6: Convert it back to alphabets.

The complex numbers are denoted by \\(C\\) . \\(x+iy=(x,y)\\) , where \\(x\\) is called real part and \\(y\\) is called imaginary part of complex number. Every real number is complex number with zero as its imaginary part. Set of Real number is a special subset of complex number \\(\\sqrt{-a}\\times\\sqrt{-b}=\\) \\((i\\sqrt{a})\\times(i\\sqrt{b})=\\) \\(i^2\\sqrt{ab}=-\\sqrt{ab}\\) . Each imaginary number ( \\(ib\\) ) is complex number( \\(a+ib\\) ) but each complex number( \\(a+ib\\) ) not an imaginary number( \\(ib\\) ). Imaginary numbers are also called pure complex numbers. Sum of four consecutive power of iota is always zero. Sum and product of two conjugate numbers are always real number.

If power is greater then \\(4\\) divide it with 4 and use above rules. If power is too large like \\(10000000004\\) add all the digits and follow above rules. Tip If power of \\(i\\) is even it must be \\(1\\) or \\(-1\\) . If power of \\(i\\) is odd it must be equal to \\(i\\) or \\(-i\\) If power of \\(i\\) is multiple of 4 then it must equal to \\(1\\) . Operations \u00b6 Operation Definition Equality of Complex Numbers \\(a+ib=c+id\\implies a=c\\land b=d\\) Addition of Complex Numbers \\(a+ib+c+id=(a+c)+(b+d)i\\) \\((a,b)+(c,d)=(a+c, b+d)\\) Scalar multiplication of complex numbers \\(k(a+ib)=ka+ikb\\) Multiplication of Complex numbers \\((a+ib)(c+ib)=(ac-bd)+(ad+bc)i\\) Division of Complex numbers $$ \\frac{(a,b)}{(c,d)}=\\left(\\frac{ac+bd}{c^2 + d^2}, \\frac{bc-ad}{c^2 + d^2}\\right) $$ Reciprocal or Multiplicative Inverse $$ \\frac{1}{z}=\\frac{a-bi}{a^2 + b^2} $$ Square Root for \\(z=a+bi\\) $$ \\pm\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{|z|+a}{2}}+ i \\sqrt{\\frac{|z|-a}{2}}\\right)\\;\\; (b>0) $$ $$ \\pm\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{|z|+a}{2}}- i \\sqrt{\\frac{|z|-a}{2}}\\right)\\;\\; (b<0) $$ Logarithm \\(\\log(z)=\\log\\vert z\\vert+i\\;arg(z)\\) Tip Multiplicative inverse of a Complex number can also be found by: $$ z {-1} = \\left(\\frac{Re(z)}{|z| 2}, -\\frac{Im(z)}{|z|^2} \\right) $$ Properties \u00b6 Operation Addition Multiplication Identity Property \\((0,0)=9+0i\\) \\((1,0)=1+0i\\) Inverse Property \\(\\forall (a,b)\\in C\\) has additive inverse \\((-a,-b)\\) \\((a,b)\\) as non-zero complex number has multiplicative inverse $$ \\left( \\frac{a}{a^2 +b^2}, \\frac{-b}{a^2 +b^2} \\right) $$ Distributive Property Multiplication is distributive over addition in \\(C\\) $$ (a,b)[(c,d)\\pm(e,f)]=(a,b)(c,d)\\pm(a,b)(e,f) $$ Conjugate of Complex Number \u00b6 Let \\(Z\\) denotes a complex number then \\(Z=x+iy=(x,y)\\) then conjugate of \\(Z\\) is denoted by \\(\\bar{Z}\\) and is defined as \\(\\bar{Z}=x-iy=(x,-y)\\) . Properties \u00b6 \\(\\forall z, z_1, z_2\\in C\\) : \\(\\overline{(\\overline{z})}=z\\) \\(z.\\overline{z}=|z|^2\\) \\(\\overline{z_1+z_2}=\\overline{z_1}+\\overline{z_2}\\) \\(\\overline{z_1-z_2}=\\overline{z_1}-\\overline{z_2}\\) \\(\\overline{z_1.z_2}=\\overline{z_1}.\\overline{z_2}\\) $$ \\overline{\\left(\\frac{z_1}{z_2}\\right)} = \\frac{\\overline{z_1}}{\\overline{z_2}}\\;\\;(z_2\\rlap{/}{=}0) $$ $$ \\frac{1}{z}=\\frac{\\bar{z}}{|z|^2} \\;\\;(z\\rlap{/}{=}0) $$ Modulus & Argument of a Complex Number \u00b6 Let \\(Z=x+iy=(x,y)\\) then: Modulus of \\(Z=|Z|=\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\\) Argument of $$ Z=arg\\;Z=\\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right) $$ Argument is also called Amplitude. Properties of Argument \u00b6 Nature of argument is just like logarithmic function. \\(arg(z_1.z_2)=arg(z_1)+arg(z_2)\\) $$ arg\\left(\\frac{z_1}{z_2}\\right)=arg(z_1)-arg(z_2) $$ $$ arg(\\overline{z})=-arg(z)=arg\\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right) $$ \\(arg(z.\\bar{z})\\) $$ arg\\left(\\frac{z}{\\bar{z}}\\right) =2arg(z) $$ \\(Aarg(z^n)=n\\; arg(z)\\) Properties of Modulus \u00b6 \\(|z|=|-z|=|\\overline{z}|=|-\\overline{z}|\\) \\(z.\\bar{z}=|z|^2\\) \\(|z^n|=|z|^2\\) \\(|z_1.z_2|=|z_1|.|z_2|\\) \\(|z_1/z_2|=|z_1|/|z_2|\\) \\(|z_1|-|z_2|\\le|z_1+z_2|\\le|z_1|+|z_2|\\) (Triangular inequality). Graphical Representation of Complex Numbers: \u00b6 Since a complex number is considered as an order pair of real numbers, so we can represent such numbers by points in a xy-plane (Cartesian plan) which is called complex plane or Argand Diagram . Info In order pair \\((a,b)\\) \\(a\\) is called x-coordinate or abscissa \\(b\\) is called y-coordinate or ordinate Principle Argument of a Complex Number \u00b6 Let \\(\\theta\\) be the principle argument of a complex number \\(x+iy\\) defined in range \\(-\\pi<\\theta\\le\\pi\\) such that: In 1 st Quadrant $$ \\theta=\\tan^{-1} \\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right) $$ In 2 nd Quadrant $$ \\theta=\\pi-\\tan^{-1} \\left(\\frac{y}{|x|}\\right) $$ In 3 rd Quadrant $$ \\theta=\\tan^{-1} \\left(\\frac{|y|}{|x|}\\right)-\\pi $$ In 4 th Quadrant $$ \\theta=-\\tan^{-1} \\left(\\frac{|y|}{x}\\right)-\\pi $$ Polar Form of Complex Numbers \u00b6 Since every complex number \\(x+iy\\) can be represented in the form of a point \\((x,y)\\) , so we can express every complex number in the form of polar coordinates \\((r,\\theta)\\) , where \\(r=\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\\) and \\(\\theta=\\tan^{-1}(y/x)\\) \\(x+iy=r\\cos\\theta+ir\\sin\\theta\\) To convert polar coordinates into Cartesian coordinates replace \\((r, \\theta)\\) into \\((r\\cos\\theta, r\\sin\\theta)\\) De Moivre's Theorem \u00b6 \\[ (\\cos\\theta+i\\sin\\theta)^n=\\cos n\\theta+i\\sin n\\theta,\\;\\;\\forall n\\in Z \\] It can be used to solve powers of Complex Numbers. Applications \u00b6 $$ (Z) {1/n} = r {1/n} \\left(\\cos\\frac{\\theta+2\\pi k}{n} + i\\sin\\frac{\\theta+2\\pi k}{n} \\right) $$ where \\(k=0,1,2,...(n-1)\\) . This formula is used to find the nth root of a complex number. \\(Z_1.Z_2=r_1r_2\\left(\\cos(\\theta_1+\\theta_2)+i\\sin(\\theta_1+\\theta_2)\\right)\\) $$ \\frac{Z_1}{Z_2}=\\frac{r_1}{r_2}(\\cos(\\theta_1-\\theta_2)+i\\sin(\\theta_1-\\theta_2)) $$ Complex numbers do not hold order axioms. Locus of a Complex Number \u00b6 A Complex number can form following in a Cartesian Plane: Circle if \\(|z|=1\\) Parabola if \\(k=|z\\pm z_1|\\) Circle if $$ \\frac{z-z_1}{z-z_2}\\rlap{/}{=}1 $$ Line if $$ \\frac{z-z_1}{z-z_2}=1 $$ \\(|z-z_1|+|z-z_2|=k\\) Ellipse if \\(k>|z_1-z_2|\\) No locus if \\(k<|z_1-z_2|\\) Line if \\(k=|z_1-z_2|\\) \\(|z-z_1|-|z-z_2|=k\\) No locus if \\(k>|z_1-z_2|\\) Hyperbola if \\(k<|z_1-z_2|\\) Line \\(k=|z_1-z_2|\\)","title":"01 - Number System"},{"location":"maths/ch01/#number-system","text":"","title":"Number System"},{"location":"maths/ch01/#decimal-representation-of-real-numbers","text":"","title":"Decimal Representation of Real Numbers"},{"location":"maths/ch01/#terminating-decimals","text":"A Decimal having finite number of digits in its decimal part.

The nth term are or general term of a sequence is denoted by \\(a_n\\) . If all members of a sequence are real numbers, then it is called real sequence . If domain of sequence is a finite set then the sequence is called a finite sequence otherwise infinite sequence . An infinite sequence has no last term. A series is obtained by adding or subtracting the terms of a sequence. If the terms of a sequence follow certain pattern then the sequence is called a progression . Types of Progression \u00b6 Arithmetic Progression (AP) Geometric Progression (GP) Harmonic Progression (HP) Arithmetic Progression \u00b6 A sequence whose terms increase or decrease by a fixed number is called Arithmetic Progression.

Geometric Progression \u00b6 A Sequence of numbers in which every term after the first is obtained from the preceding term by multiplying it with a constant number is called a Geometric Progression The general form of a GP is $$ a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, ..., ar^{n-1} $$ The general term of GP is $$ a_n=ar^{n-1} $$ The constant ratio of any two constant terms in GP is called by Common Ratio . It can be found by $$ \\frac{a_n}{a_{n-1}} $$ Common Ratio can never be zero or one. If a GP has n-terms then nth term is called last term or limiting term and it is denoted by \\(l\\) & is given by \\(l=ar^{n-1}\\) If \\(a_m\\) and \\(a_n\\) are two terms of an GP whereas \\(a_m>a_n\\) also \\(m>n\\) . Then $$ r=\\left(\\frac{a_m}{a_n}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{m-n}} $$ When last term \\(l\\) and common ratio \\(r\\) is given then: $$ a_n= \\frac{l}{r^{n-1}} $$ If first term ( \\(a\\) ) and common ratio is given the nth term from last can be given by \\(ar^{m-n}\\) Number of terms can be calculated by using formula $$ r^n = \\frac{a_n}{a_1} r $$ Info If we have to take three numbers in GP we take these to be $$ \\frac{a}{r}, a, ar $$ If we have to take four numbers in GP we take these to be $$ \\frac{a}{r^3}, \\frac{a}{r}, ar, ar^3 $$ If we have to take five numbers in GP we take these to be $$ \\frac{a}{r^2}, \\frac{a}{r}, a, ar, ar^2 $$ Properties \u00b6 After applying any basic mathematic operation on each of its term the progression remains in GP. If we have two GP, the progression formed by the product or division of its corresponding terms, is also in GP. In a G.P. of finitely many terms, the product of terms equidistant from the beginning and end is constant equal to the sum of the first and last terms. Geometric Mean \u00b6 If three quantities are in GP then middle term is known as geometric means of the other two. If \\(a\\) , \\(G\\) , \\(b\\) are in GP, then \\(G=\\pm\\sqrt{ab}\\) . If \\(a\\) , \\(G_1\\) , \\(G_2\\) ,..., \\(G_n\\) , \\(b\\) then the numbers \\(G_1\\) , \\(G_2\\) ,..., \\(G_n\\) are called n geometric means between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) . nth GM between \\(a\\) & \\(b\\) is given by $$ G_n=a\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right)^{\\frac{n}{n+1}} $$ The product if \\(n\\) geometric means between two given number is equal to nth power to single GM between these numbers. \\(n\\) GM between \\(a\\) & \\(b\\) is \\(G_n=(\\sqrt{ab})^n\\) or \\(a^n(b/a)^{n/2}\\) If \\(A\\) & \\(G\\) are respectively arithmetic and geometric means between two positive numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) then: \\(A>G\\) The quadratic equation having \\(a\\) & \\(b\\) as its roots is \\(x^2-2Ax+G^2=0\\) The two positive numbers are \\(A\\) & \\(\\pm\\sqrt{A^2-G^2}\\) Geometric Series \u00b6 If \\(a\\) , \\(ar\\) , \\(ar^2\\) ,..., \\(ar^{n-1}\\) is a GP then $$ a+ar+ar^2 +ar^3 +...+ ar^{n-1} $$ is called Geometric Series. Sum of \\(n\\) terms of Geometric Series \u00b6 Following are some formulas of Sum of Geometric Series: $$ S_n=\\frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}, |r|<1 $$ \\[ S_n=\\frac{a-lr}{1-r}, |r|<1 \\] \\[ S_n=\\frac{a(r^n-1)}{r-1}, |r|>1 \\] $$ S_n=\\frac{lr-a}{r-1}, |r|>1 $$ where \\(l\\) is last term of GP. MCQ Trick Finding total covered by the object dropped from height \\(h\\) and rebounds \\(r\\) th of its actual height. $$ \\text{distance}=\\frac{h(1+r)}{1-r} $$ Sum of infinite Geometric Series \u00b6 The series \\(a+\\) \\(ar^2+\\) \\(ar^3+\\) ... \\(+ar^{n-1}+\\) ... \\(\\infty\\) is called infinite geometric series . We can compute the sum only if \\(|r|<1\\) Case 1 \\(|r|<1\\) \u00b6 If for an infinite geometric series \\(|r|<1\\) , the series is said to be Convergent Series . In this case $$ S_\\infty=\\frac{a_1}{1-r} $$ Sum of infinite Geometric Series when common ratio and first term is given can be found by: $$ S_\\infty=\\frac{1}{r}\\times a_1 $$ Case 2 \\(|r|>1\\) \u00b6 If for an infinite geometric series \\(|r|>1\\) , the series is said to be Divergent Series . In this case sum of series increases indefinitely so: $$ S_\\infty \\to \\infty $$ Case 3 \\(|r|=1\\) \u00b6 In this case also sum of series increases indefinitely, but we can calculated its sum if its is not infinite ie. \\(n\\) is given Thus $$ S_n=na_1 $$ Case 3 \\(|r|=-1\\) \u00b6 If for an infinite geometric series \\(r=-1\\) , then series is said to be Oscillatory Series . In this case $$ S_n=\\frac{a_1-(-1)^na_1}{2} $$ Thus: \\(S_n=a_1\\) if \\(n\\) is positive odd number \\(S_n=0\\) if \\(n\\) is positive even number. Arithmetic Geometric Progression (AGP) \u00b6 It is the combination of Arithmetic & Geometric Progressions. General form of AGP is $$ a, (a+d)r, (a+2d)r^2, (a+3d)r^3, ... $$ nth term of an AGP is $$ T_n=[a+(n-1)d]r^{n-1} $$ Note A sequence is both an A.P. and a G.P. iff it is a constant sequence. Harmonic Progression \u00b6 A sequence of numbers is called a harmonic progression if the reciprocals of its terms are in arithmetic progression. No term of HP can be zero Every HP has a corresponding AP There is no general method to find the sum of a HP. Harmonic Mean \u00b6 If three quantities are in HP then the middle is called harmonic mean of other two. If \\(a\\) , \\(H\\) , \\(b\\) are in HP then $$ H=\\frac{2ab}{a+b} $$ nth harmonic mean between \\(a\\) & \\(b\\) is given by $$ H_n=\\frac{(n+1)ab}{na+b} $$ Relation between AP, GP & HP \u00b6 \\(G^2=AH\\) \\(A>G>H\\) , if \\(a\\) & \\(b\\) are two distinct +ve real numbers and G>0. \\(A<G<H\\) , if \\(a\\) & \\(b\\) are two distinct -ve real numbers and G<0. Reciprocals of GP form a GP Reciprocals of AP form HP If \\(a^x\\) , \\(b^y\\) , \\(c^z\\) are in GP then \\(x\\) , \\(y\\) , \\(z\\) are in HP If \\(a^x\\) , \\(b^y\\) , \\(c^z\\) are in GP then \\(1/x\\) , \\(1/y\\) , \\(1/z\\) are in AP The number \\(\\frac{1}{a}\\) , \\(\\frac{a+b}{2ab}\\) , \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\) are in GP The reciprocal of whose terms form again same type of sequence is HP If the first term of an infinite geometric series is equal to twice of the sum of all the terms of that follows it, then the value of \\(r\\) is \\(1/3\\) . If \\(a\\) , \\(b\\) , \\(c\\) form a G.P with common ratio \\(r\\) \\((0<r<1)\\) .If \\(a\\) , \\(2b\\) , \\(3c\\) form an A.P then \\(r=1/3\\) . Three numbers of G.P. If we double the middle number we get an A.P the common ratio of G.P is \\(2\\pm\\sqrt{3}\\) . Every term of GP is the logarithm of each term of AP. Every term of AP is the anti logarithm of term of GP. If \\(a\\) , \\(b\\) , \\(c\\) are in HP then \\(bc\\) , \\(ca\\) , \\(ab\\) are in AP. If \\(a\\) , \\(b\\) , \\(c\\) are in AP then \\(\\frac{1}{1-a}\\) , \\(\\frac{1}{1-b}\\) , \\(\\frac{1}{1-c}\\) are in HP. The expression $$ \\frac{a^n + b^n }{a^{n-1} + b^{n-1}} $$ is: AM when \\(n=1\\) GM when \\(n=1/2\\) HM when \\(n=0\\) The expression $$ \\frac{a^{n+1} + b^{n+1} }{a n+b n} $$ is: AM when \\(n=0\\) GM when \\(n=-1/2\\) HM when \\(n=-1\\) Relation with Quadratic Equation \u00b6 If \\(\\alpha\\) & \\(\\beta\\) be roots of the quadratic equation \\(x^2-2Ax+G^2=0\\) then: AM = \\(\\frac{\\alpha+\\beta}{2}\\) GM = \\(\\sqrt{\\alpha\\beta}\\) HM = \\(\\frac{2\\alpha\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta}\\) Let \\(a\\) & \\(b\\) are two numbers and if \\(a=b\\) then $$ \\text{GM} = \\text{HM} = \\text{AM} $$ When quadratic equation is \\(ax^2+bx+c=0\\) then: AM = \\(\\frac{-b}{2a}\\) HM = \\(\\frac{-2c}{b}\\) GM = \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{c}{a}}\\) If \\(A\\) & \\(G\\) are Arithmetic and Geometric means between \\(a\\) & \\(b\\) then the quadratic equation having roots \\(a\\) & \\(b\\) will be $$ x^2 - 2Ax + G^2=0 $$ Sigma Notations \u00b6 \\[ \\displaystyle\\sum^n_{k=1} [k^m-(k-1)^m]=n^m \\] Sum \\(n\\) times unity $$ \\displaystyle\\sum^n_{k=1} 1=n $$ Sum of first \\(n\\) natural numbers is given by $$ \\displaystyle\\sum^n_{k=1} k = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} $$ The sum of first \\(n\\) even natural number is given by \\(n(n+1)\\) The sum of first \\(n\\) odd natural number is given by \\(n^2\\) The sum of squares of first \\(n\\) natural numbers is given by $$ \\displaystyle\\sum^n_{k=1} k^2=\\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} $$ The sum of squares of first \\(n\\) odd natural numbers is given by $$ \\frac{n(4n^2-1)}{3} $$ The sum of squares of first \\(n\\) even natural number is given by $$ \\frac{2n(n+1)(2n+1)}{3} $$ The sum of cube of first \\(n\\) natural number is given by $$ \\displaystyle\\sum^n_{k=1} k 3 = \\frac{n(n+1) 2}{2} $$ The sum of cube of first \\(n\\) even natural number is given by \\(2n^2(n+1)^2\\) The sum of cube of first \\(n\\) odd natural number is given by \\(n^2(2n^2-1)\\) nth Term of Repeated Series \u00b6 nth term of series like \\(b+\\) \\(bb+\\) \\(bbb+\\) ... is $$ a_n=\\frac{b}{9}(10^n-1) $$ nth term of series like \\(0.b+\\) \\(0.bb+\\) \\(0.bb+\\) ... is $$ a_n=\\frac{b}{9}(1-10^n) $$ Vulgar Fraction \u00b6 A type of decimal fraction in which the decimals repeats endlessly is called recurring or repeated decimals . For example: 0.31313131... Every recurring decimal can be converted into a fraction called common fraction or vulgar fraction by using formula for \\(S_\\infty\\) . Conversion \u00b6 Here are some key points to convert recurring decimals into vulgar fraction within seconds. Case 1 When all digits are recurring \u00b6 In this case, in the denominator of vulgar fraction, the number of nines is equal to number of repeating digits and numerator is actually the complete given number without decimal, minus the number before decimal. Example \u00b6 Vulgar Fraction of \\(2.\\overline{342}\\) will be $$ \\frac{2342-2}{999}=\\frac{2340}{999} $$ \\(13.\\overline{4235}\\) will be $$ \\frac{134235-13}{9999}=\\frac{13422}{9999} $$ \\(0.\\overline{271}\\) will be $$ \\frac{0271-0}{999}=\\frac{271}{999} $$ Case 2 When all digits are not repeating \u00b6 In this case, in the denominator of vulgar fraction, the number of nines is equal to the number of repeating digits and after nines we put zeros and the number of zeros is equal to the number of non-repeating digits in decimal part. The numerator is the whole given number without decimal minus the number before repeating digits. Example \u00b6 \\(2.1\\overline{341}\\) will be $$ \\frac{21341-21}{9990}=\\frac{21320}{9990} $$ \\(0.02\\overline{1}\\) will be $$ \\frac{0021-002}{900}=\\frac{19}{900} $$","title":"06 - Sequence & Series"},{"location":"maths/ch06/#sequences-series","text":"","title":"Sequences &amp; Series"},{"location":"maths/ch06/#sequence","text":"Quote A Sequence is an arrangement of numbers subject to some definite rule.

Scientific Notation \u00b6 The standard to express the number in term of power of ten is called Scientific Notation. Some standard prefixes for power of ten with their symbols are presented below: Factor Prefix Symbol Factor Prefix Symbol \\(10^{-18}\\) atto \\(a\\) \\(10^{1}\\) deca \\(da\\) \\(10^{-15}\\) femto \\(f\\) \\(10^{3}\\) kilo \\(k\\) \\(10^{-12}\\) pico \\(p\\) \\(10^{6}\\) mega \\(M\\) \\(10^{-9}\\) nano \\(n\\) \\(10^{9}\\) giga \\(G\\) \\(10^{-6}\\) micro \\(u\\) \\(10^{12}\\) tera \\(T\\) \\(10^{-3}\\) milli \\(m\\) \\(10^{15}\\) peta \\(P\\) \\(10^{-2}\\) centi \\(c\\) \\(10^{18}\\) exa \\(E\\) \\(10^{-1}\\) deci \\(d\\) Do you Know? There should be one non-zero digit to left of decimal in scientific notation. Error \u00b6 The difference between standard and experimental values is called error. Classification of Errors \u00b6 Assignable Errors (Systematic Errors) Unassignable Errors (Random Errors) Assignable Errors \u00b6 The errors to which we can assign a cause usually they follow same trend of variations so a cause can be assigned to them eg. Errors occurring due to the LC of the measuring instrument. Remedy \u00b6 Such errors can be controlled experimentally while carefully monitoring the measurement process. Unassignable Error \u00b6 To which we can't assign a cause because they do not follow a trend. So these errors are due to unknown causes. Remedy \u00b6 These errors can't be controlled experimentally, but a statistical tool of taking average of several value is employed to minimize them. Significant figures \u00b6 Uncertainty in the measurements leads us to establish some standard to write the numerical value of a measurement, termed as significant figure. \"In any measurement, all the accurately known digits and the first doubtful digit are named as significant figures.\" Rules of significant figures \u00b6 In order to determine significant figures in a number we must follow the following rules: * All the non-zero digits are significant figures. For Example: 3,456 has four significant figures. 12.3456 has six significant figures. * Zeros between non-zero digits are significant. For Example: 2306 has four significant figures. 20,0894 has six significant figures. * Zeros locating the position of decimal in numbers o not significant. For Example: In the 0.2224 and 0.000034, zeros are not significant * Final zeros to the right of the decimal point are significant. For Example: 3.0000 has four significant zeros. 1002.00 has four significant zeros. * Zeros that locate decimal point in numbers greater than one are not significant. For Example: 3000 has only one significant figure. 120000 has two significant figures. Do you know? Greater the significant figures in measurement the more accurate it is. Algebra with Significant Figures \u00b6 Division and Multiplication \u00b6 \\(\\frac{4.54\\times 2.324}{1.3365} = 7.89447063 =\\) an answer having maximum of three digits can he retained here \\(= 7.89\\) . \\(4.3458\\times 2.7 = 11.73366 =\\) an answer having maximum of two digits can he retained here \\(= 12\\) The factor having the smallest number of significant figures is called least accurate factor, and product and quotient cannot have number of significant figures more than that in the least accurate factor Addition and Subtraction \u00b6 Search for the least number of decimal places, counting the number of significant figures is not required. For example: \\(4.345+ 23.51= 27.855 =\\) an answer having maximum of two decimal places \\(= 27.86\\) \\(101.2401-1.0=100.2401=\\) an answer having maximum of one decimal place \\(=100.2\\) \\(101.2401-1=100.2401=\\) an answer having no decimal place \\(=100\\) Rounding Off Data \u00b6 Rule # 1: \u00b6 If the digit to be dropped is greater than 5, then add 1 to the last digit to b, retained and drop all digits farther to the right. For example: \\(3.677\\) is rounded off to \\(3.68\\) if we need three significant figures in measurement. \\(3.677\\) is rounded off to \\(3.7\\) if we need two significant figures in measurement. Rule # 2: \u00b6 If the digit to be dropped is less than 5, then simply drop it without adding any digit number to the last digit. For example: \\(6.632\\) is rounded off to \\(6,63\\) if we need three significant figures in measurement. \\(6.632\\) is rounded off to \\(6.6\\) if we need two significant figures in measurement. Rule # 3: \u00b6 If the digit to be dropped is exactly 5 then: Case 1 \u00b6 If the digit to be retained is even, then just drop the \"5\". For example: \\(6.65\\) is rounded off to \\(6.6\\) if we need two significant figures in measurement. \\(3.4665\\) is rounded off to \\(6.466\\) if we need four significant figures in measurement. Case 1 \u00b6 If the digit to be retained is odd, then add 1 to it. For example: \\(6.35\\) is rounded off to \\(6.4\\) if we need two significant figures in measurement. \\(3.4675\\) is rounded off to \\(6.468\\) if we need four significant figures in measurement: Note Zero is an even number So, \\(3.05\\) is rounded off to \\(3.0\\) if we need two significant figures in measurement. PRECISION & ACCURACY \u00b6 Precision \u00b6 The precision of a measurement is determined by the least count of the instrument or device. Smaller the least count of instrument, more precise is the measurement. Accuracy \u00b6 The accuracy of a measurement depends upon the fractional or percentage uncertainty in the measurement. Smaller the percentage error, more accurate is the measurement. Maximum absolute uncertainty is equal to one least count of the measuring instrument. Assessment of Total Uncertainty in the Final Result \u00b6 Total uncertainty in the final result can be determined by the following rules: In case of addition and subtraction absolute uncertainties are to be added. In case of multiplication and division fractional or percentage errors are to be added. For power factor the power is multiplied with the percentage uncertainty. For example: In the equation \\(u= kx^a\\) , \\(a \\times \\text{percentage error in} x \\text{, where} k \\text{is constant of proportionality}\\) . Uncertainty in the average value of many measurements of the same quantity is the mean of absolute differences of measurements form the average value. For time measurement, uncertainty is obtained by dividing the least count of the timing device with the number of vibrations. Do you know? Counting more number of vibrations can reduce the uncertainty in the timing experiments. Dimensions \u00b6 Each basic measurable physical quantity is represented in term of base quantities by a specific symbol for them written with in square brackets is called dimension. The dimensions are helpful in: Deriving a possible formula Checking the homogeneity of a physical equation or formula. Limitations of Dimensional Analysis \u00b6 Dimension analysis has no information on dimensionless constants. If a quantity is dependent on trigonometric or exponential function, this method cannot be used. In some cases, it is difficult to guess the factors while deriving the relation connecting two or more physical quantities. This method cannot be used in an equation containing two or more variables with same dimensions.","title":"01 - Measurements"},{"location":"physics/ch01/#measurements","text":"","title":"Measurements"},{"location":"physics/ch01/#steps-to-measure-quantities","text":"Comparison of quantity to be measured with a standard measuring tool.

Waves transport energy without transporting matter. Classification of Waves \u00b6 Visible Waves (Water waves, String waves) Invisible Waves (Sound waves, Matter waves, Radio waves) Info In case of mechanical waves we deal with the cooperative motion of a collection of particles. Classification on the Basis of Nature \u00b6 Mechanical waves (require medium for propagation) Sound waves String waves Water waves Electromagnetic waves (do not require medium for propagation) Radio waves Heat waves Light waves Progressive / Traveling Waves \u00b6 Traveling wave is that which propagates or distributes specific its pulses in space along specific direction. For example: Waves on a string Waves on a water surface Periodic Waves \u00b6 Periodic waves are those, which are repeated in regular interval of time periodic wave may be transverse or longitudinal. Transverse Waves \u00b6 Displacement of medium is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the waves. Transverse waves cannot propagate in a gas or a liquid because there is no mechanism for driving motion perpendicular to the propagation of the wave. Transverse waves may occur on a string, on the surface of a liquid. and throughout a solid. A ripple in a pond and a wave on a string are easily visualized as transverse waves. In fluids, transverse waves die out very quickly and usually cannot be produced at all. Longitudinal Waves \u00b6 Displacement of the medium is parallel to the propagation of the wave. A wave in a \"slinky\" is a good visualization. Sound waves in air are longitudinal waves. Info The waves transport both energy and momentum in a medium. Transverse Periodic Waves \u00b6 In a time interval equal to time period, a particle in the wave travels a distance equal to wavelength. For all waves \\(v=f\\lambda\\) The particles in the wave separated by a distance which is integral multiple of \\(\\lambda\\) i.e. \\(n\\lambda\\) are in phase motion with each other. The particles separated by a distance which is odd multiple of \\(\\lambda\\) i.e: $$ \\left(n+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\lambda $$ are out phase to each other. Sound \u00b6 A vibrating body produces sound waves ( \\(\\lambda = 1m\\) ). Three things are essential for the detection of sound: Vibrating body for production of sound Medium for propagation of sound Listener (ear) for the detection of sound Sound waves are longitudinal waves having three dimensional propagation in air. Longitudinal sound waves consist of compressions and rarefactions. Compression is a region where crowding of articles of medium is maximum Rarefaction is region where crowding of particles of medium is minimum. Sound waves produce Reflection, Refraction, Diffraction, Interference but not polarization because sound waves are longitudinal. Wave Speed ( \\(m/s\\) ) EM Waves \\(300,000,000\\) Sound in Air \\(340\\) Sound in water \\(1500\\) Sound in steel \\(5000\\) Sound Intensity \u00b6 Sound intensity is defined as the sound power per unit area. The usual context is the measurement of sound intensity in the air at a listener's location. The basic units are \\(watt/m^2\\) or \\(watt/cm^2\\) The most common approach to sound intensity measurement is to use the decibel scale $$ 1(dB)=10\\log_{10} \\left[\\frac{I}{I_o}\\right] $$ Velocity in Air \u00b6 Speed of any mechanical wave is found by the following formula $$ v=\\sqrt{\\frac{E}{\\rho}} $$ where \\(E=\\) modulus if elasticity of medium , \\(\\rho=\\) density of medium. In gases, sound travels in the form of compressional wave; and gases have bulk modulus of elasticity. So for gases, we get $$ v=\\sqrt{\\frac{E_{\\text{bulk}}}{\\rho}} $$ Newton proved that for air the isothermal modulus of elasticity is \\(E_{\\text{bulk}}=P\\) , and speed of sound is $$ V=\\sqrt{\\frac{P}{\\rho}} $$ At STP the speed of sound in sir is $$ v=\\sqrt{\\frac{hdg}{\\rho}} $$ $$ v=\\sqrt{\\frac{76 \\times 13.6 \\times 981}{0.001293}} $$ $$ \\;=28100cm/s=281m/s $$ Whereas experimental value is \\(332m/s\\) Percentage error in Newtons' Calculation was \\(16\\) % because of assumption that sound propagate through sir isothermally. Laplace corrected Newton's formula by proposing that \"Sound wave does not propagates in air isothermally but adiabatically\" Laplace's formula is given as: $$ v=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma P}{\\rho}} $$ where \\(\\gamma P=\\) \\(E_{\\text{bulk}}=\\) adiabatic elastic modulus of fluid and \\(\\gamma=\\frac{C_p}{C_v}=1.42\\) (for air) Experimentally it is found that speed of sound increases by \\(0.61m/s\\) , or \\(61 cm/s\\) for each \\(1^oC\\) rise in temperature. Effect of moisture \u00b6 water vapours are lighter than air, thus the presence of moisture in air reduces density and hence the speed of sound increases in such cases. Dependence of velocity of sound \u00b6 \\(v\\) is independent of pressure $$ v\\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\rho}} $$ $$ v\\propto \\sqrt{T} $$ $$ \\frac{v_1}{v_2}=\\sqrt{\\frac{T_1}{T_2}} $$ \\(v_t=v_o+0.61t\\) Info The speed of sound in hydrogen is four times more than the speed of sound in oxygen at same temperature Principle of Superposition \u00b6 When two or more waves reach a point of the medium simultaneously then the resultant displacement at that point of the medium is equal to sum of the individual displacements produced by each wove. This is called principle of superposition $$ Y_{\\text{total}}= Y_1+Y_2+Y_3+....+Y_n $$ Applications \u00b6 Interference \u00b6 It is produced by superposition of two waves of same frequencies, which are traveling in the same direction. Beats \u00b6 These are produced by two waves of slightly different frequencies traveling in the same direction. Stationary Waves \u00b6 These are produced by two waves of equal frequency and equal amplitude traveling along same line in opposite direction. Interference Of Sound \u00b6 Superposition (mixing up) of two identical sound waves while passing through same medium propagating along same direction is called their interference. Conditions for Interference \u00b6 Coherent waves Same medium Same direction Identical waves Sources of sound should be close to each other In constructive interference, two interfering sound waves reinforce each other, so that the resultant is a louder sound. Condition for Constructive Interference \u00b6 Paths different \\(=n\\lambda\\) where \\(n=1,\\pm1,\\pm2,.....\\) Echoing zone is region of constructive interference In destructive interference, two interfering sound cancel each other's effect, so that the resultant loudness of sound wave is become fainter. Condition for Destructive Interference \u00b6 Path difference $$ \\left(n+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\lambda $$ where \\(n=0,\\pm1,\\pm2,....\\) Silence zone is region of destructive interference Path difference is the difference between lengths of paths traveled by two waves in reaching the same point. Beats \u00b6 The periodic alterations of sound between maximum and minimum loudness are called beats. * Beats are produced by the super position of two waves having slightly different frequencies traveling in same medium along same direction. * Beat frequency is defined as number of beats per second. * Absolute difference between frequencies of producing beats is equal to beat frequency \\(f_{\\text{beat}}=|f_{A}-f_{B}|\\) Info If frequency of a tuning fork is 32 Hz then after \u00be sec, it will complete 24 vibrations. Maximum detectable beat frequency for normal human ear is 10Hz. Beats are used to: Determine unknown frequencies Tune musical instruments Reflection of waves \u00b6 All kinds of wave shows reflection When reflection of wave takes place from denser boundary, the phase of waves reverses. In this case, reflection co-efficient is maximum and transmission co-efficient is almost zero except for quantum mechanical transmission of particle from potential barrier. Info The reflected wave has the same wavelength and frequency but its phase may change depending on the nature of reflecting medium. When reflection takes place from rarer boundary, there is no phase reversal. In this case, reflection co-efficient and transmission coefficient have considerable values Transmission of Waves \u00b6 Practically amplitude of transmitted wave is less than that of incident wave because some of energy of incident wave is wasted at point of discontinuity Frequency of transmitted wave is same as that of incident wave but its velocity depends on density of medium as given $$ v\\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\rho}} $$ Since velocity of transmitted wave is different from original wave, therefore, wave length ( \\(\\lambda\\) ) changes as frequencies of both waves are equal Standing Waves \u00b6 Super position of two identical waves traveling opposite to each other in the same medium simultaneously, gives rise to stationary or standing waves Both constructive and destructive interference takes place in the formation of stationary waves. Points of constructive interference are called antinodes while points of destructive interference are called nodes Amplitude is maximum at antinodes and minimum (zero) at nodes. Nodes are stationary points whereas antinodes are points that vibrate with maximum amplitude. Two consecutive nodes or antinodes are separated by distance equal to \\(\\lambda/2\\) and an antinode and its consecutive node by \\(\\lambda/4\\) . Info The energy stored in anti nodes at their extreme position is wholly potential while at equilibrium position the energy stored is wholly kinetic but total energy remains the same. Standing Waves in Stretched String \u00b6 At fixed end of string always node is formed while at free end of string, always antinode is formed. Info The speed of stationary waves is independent of the No. of loops. If string is fixed at both ends, then number of nodes is one greater than no of antinodes \\(N = A+1\\) If string is free at one to end, then no. of antinodes is equal to that of nodes. \\(A = N\\) Speed of string wave is $$ v=\\sqrt{\\frac{T}{m}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{F}{m}} $$ \\(m\\) is called linear mass density. Only the following quantized frequencies of transverse stationary waves on stretched string can be produced. \\(f_n=nf_1\\) where \\(n=1,2,3,...\\) , $$ f_1=\\frac{1}{2l}\\sqrt{\\frac{T}{m}} $$ \\(f_1\\) is the lowest frequency (fundamental or basic frequency) at which first Stationary wave is formed.

Following are the types of wave front: Spherical wave front: Set of points, which determine the surface of sphere. Cylindrical wave front: Set of points, which determine the surface of cylinder. Plane wave front: A small part of spherical or cylindrical wave front at very large distance from source of light. Point light sources produce spherical wave fronts. When a point source is placed at focus of converging lens, plane wave fronts are obtained in laboratory. Plane wave fronts reach from the Sun to the Earth, as the earth is far off from the sun. The distance between two consecutive wave fronts is one wavelength. A line normal to the wave front including the direction of motion is called a ray of light. Info A point source of light placed at principal focus of convex lens will produce a plane slave. Huygen's Principle \u00b6 Every point on wave front acts as a source of secondary spherical wavelets, which propagate in forward direction with speed of light. Position of new wave front is tangent envelope to all of secondary wavelets. Radius of hemisphere \\(=c\\Delta t\\) There is an infinite number of secondary wavelets present on wave front. Light ray is associated with direction of flow of light energy. In a homogeneous medium, the energy of wave is transmitted wave front remains spherical for long. Interference of Light \u00b6 Interference is the superposition or two light waves of same frequency and promoting in same medium along same direction very close to each other. For constructive interference, light waves reach a point in phase their path difference \\(=n\\lambda\\) For destructive interference, light waves reach apoint in out of phase and their path difference \\(=(2n+1)\\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\) Conditions for interference of light \u00b6 Monochromatic (Having single wave length) Coherence (Haying constant phase difference) Same direction Same medium Very Close to each other. There is no perfect monochromatic source, but by using filters it is possible to produce a source that gives light whose wavelength differ by \\(\\pm5\\times10^{-10}m\\) If phase difference between two waves remains constant, then interference pattern will be stationary on screen otherwise it will change continuously. For two ordinary sources, no interference pattern is obtained, because the phase changes rapidly and irregularly (that's why to get two coherent waves a single beam of light is split into two or more beams). Optical path is equal to product of refractive index of medium and distance covered in air. $$ \\text{Optical path} = nd $$ where \\(n\\) is refractive index and \\(d\\) is path in air. Young's Double Slit Experiment \u00b6 Path difference \\(=d\\sin\\theta\\) For bright fringes: $$ d\\sin\\theta = m\\lambda $$ 1 st bright fringe at \\(m=0\\) For dark fringes: $$ d\\sin\\theta = (2m+1)\\frac{\\lambda}{2} $$ 1 st dark fringe at \\(m=0\\) Position of mth bright fringe $$ y_m=\\frac{m\\lambda D}{d} $$ Position of mth dark fringe $$ y_m=(2m+1)\\frac{\\lambda D}{2d} $$ Wavelength from bright fringe $$ \\lambda=y_m\\frac{d}{m D} $$ Wavelength from dark fringe $$ \\lambda = 2y_m\\frac{D}{(2m+1)d} $$ Distance between centers of two consecutive dark fringes or bright fringes is called fringe width. $$ \\text{Fringe Width}=\\frac{\\lambda D}{d} $$ applicable both for bright or dark fringes. Interference in Different Types of Films \u00b6 Thin film of refracting medium having thickness comparable to the wavelength of light rays e.g. Oil film on water Soap film Air film When exposed to white light, thin film produces colorful pattern due to interference. When exposed to monochromatic light, only bright and dark fringes are obtained Types of thin Films \u00b6 Uniform or Parallel Thin Films \u00b6 Whose thickness is uniform. It gives straight interference pattern. Wedge-shaped films \u00b6 Whose thickness is zero at one end and then increases uniformly. Its interference pattern comprises a set of parallel fringes all parallel to the edge of wedge. Wedge shaped films can be obtained using a spacer between the two slides of glass. The thinnest part of wedge film shaped is always dark, due to additional path difference of \\(\\lambda/2\\) , caused by phase reversal, at denser medium. Newton's Rings \u00b6 Newton's rings are practical study of interference in wedge shaped thin films. When sodium light is incident on the plano convex lens system, light rays reflect from upper and, lower layers of the air present between lens and the glass plate. The sodium light source is almost monochromatic. There is no phase change at the lens-air surface, because the wave is going from a higher to a lower refraction index medium. At the air-plate surface, however, there is a phase shift of \\(180^o\\) with the reflection from a medium of higher refractive index. Waves reflected from these two surfaces interfere, forming bright bands where the path length in air produces two waves in phase and dark bands where the waves are out of phase. The centre of the pattern is black. The fringes are circular as the locus of points of equal thickness of air is a circle Conditions for interference are reversed for Newton's rings as: Path difference \\(= m\\lambda\\) (for dark ring) Path difference \\(=(2m +1)\\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\) (for bright ring) This is due to phase reversal by 180\u00b0 which is equivalent to an extra path difference of \\(\\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\) Point of contact is always dark due to phase reversal at point of contact. Here actual physical path difference is zero. Primary & Secondary Colors \u00b6 Red, green and blue colors are called primary colors. Complementary colors of white light are those two colors, whose combined effect is to produce white light on eye. They are: Red and blue - green Yellow and blue - violet Green and purple (mixture of red and blue) If two primary colors of white light are mixed, we get complementary colors. e.g. red and green primary colors are mixed, we get yellow, which is complementary color of blue-violet. Luminous, Non-Luminous & Incandescent \u00b6 A luminous object is one that emits its own light e.g. sun A non-luminous object is that which is visible by light it reflects. e.g. moon Incandescent object is that which emits light due to heating, e.g. filament of electric bulb. Michelson Interferometer \u00b6 Michelson interferometers is an optical instrument used for following purposes Testing lenses, mirrors and prisms. Measurement of refractive indices. Thickness of thin plate through which light can pass. Interferometers are based upon the Principle of division of wave front Michelson's interferometer consists of following essential parts: Diffused source of monochromatic light. Beam splitter (semi-silvered glass plate). plane mirrors held perpendicular to each other, one is fixed and the other is movable Micrometer (it is attached to movables mirror) Compensator (glass plate equal in thickness to beams splitter and of the same material as that of beam splitter). Telescope (to observe interference fringes) If mirror is moved by a distance of \\(\\lambda/2\\) , with dark fringe in view, then fringe of same kind is observed because total path difference is \\(\\lambda\\) . If mirror is moved by distance of \\(\\lambda/4\\) , then alternatively, dark and bright fringes can be observed because total path difference is \\(\\lambda/2\\) . If mirror is moved through distance \\(p\\) , and \\(m\\) fringes pass before eye. $$ p=\\frac{m\\lambda}{2} $$ Interferometer can be used: To determine refractive index To test planes of glass slabs and lenses To determine wavelength of light Diffraction of Light \u00b6 Bending of light around sharp edges is called diffraction or the spreading of light waves into geometrical shadow of an obstacle and redistribution of light intensity resulting in dark and bright fringes is called diffraction of light. The smaller is the size of diffracting object (obstacle), the higher the degree of diffraction is observed. Interference Diffraction Superposition of few secondary wavelets is involved. Superposition of large number of secondary wavelets is involved. Interference fringes are equal in size. Diffraction fringes wide near diffracting object and become small as one move away from it. Interference fringes are equally spaced. Diffraction fringes become narrow as distance from diffracting object increases. Points of destructive interference are perfectly dark. Points of minimum intensity are not perfectly dark. Diffraction due to Narrow Slit \u00b6 Diffraction due to a narrow slit has central maximum and alternating secondary minima and maxima on its both sides. Condition for mth order minima on either side of center is given by $$ D\\sin\\theta=m\\lambda $$ where \\(m = 1,2,3,...\\) And \\(D\\) is width of slit. Diffraction Grating \u00b6 Diffraction grating is a multi-slit arrangement of parallel and equally spaced slits. Suppose monochromatic light is directed at the grating parallel to its axis as shown. Let the distance between successive slits be \\(d\\) . The diffraction pattern on the screen is the result of the combined effects of diffraction and interference. Each slit causes diffraction, and the diffracted beams in turn interfere with one another to produce the pattern. The path difference between waves from any two adjacent slits can be found by dropping a perpendicular line between the parallel waves. By geometry, this path difference is \\(d\\sin\\theta\\) . If the path difference equals one wavelength or some integral multiple of a wavelength, waves from all slits will be in phase and a bright line will be observed. Therefore, the condition for maxima in the interference pattern at the angle \\(\\theta\\) is $$ d\\sin\\theta=m\\lambda $$ where \\(m = 0,1,2,3....\\) Because \\(d\\) is very small for diffraction grating, a beam of monochromatic light passing through a diffraction grating splits into very narrow maxima (bright fringes) at large angles 0. Info Practically a diffraction grating is a piece of glass with 400 5000 lines per cm. Lines are opaque while separation between them is transparent, so space between two engraved lines behaves as slit. Distance between two slits is called grating element. \\(d = 1/N\\) where \\(N\\) is the number of lines in one unit length. Grating equation is given as \\(d\\sin\\theta = m\\lambda\\) where \\(m\\) is called the order of diffraction pattern. For white light, we see colored fringes. Resolving power of grating is its ability to separate two wavelengths of light in given order of their spectrum. $$ \\text{Resolving Power} = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\Delta\\lambda}= N \\times m $$ where \\(N=\\) number of lines ruled on grating, \\(m=\\) order of diffraction \\(\\Delta\\lambda\\) difference in two wavelengths to be resolved by the grating. Diffraction of X-Rays by Crystals \u00b6 Bragg's law is given as $$ 2d\\sin\\theta = m\\lambda $$ Where \\(d\\) is called lattice spacing and \\(\\theta\\) is called angle of diffraction. Solid crystals behave as very good natural diffraction gratings and ultraviolet light is diffracted from layers of atoms. Inter atomic layer distance is called lattice constant. In 1913, Max Von Laue suggested that since atomic layers in solid \\(NaCl\\) have layer separation of \\(10^{-10}m\\) , therefore, X-rays can be diffracted. Max von laue pattern on film is in the form of dark spots/bright spots. Analysis of the relative intensity of dark/bright spots gives rise to crystal structure of solid. Note Diffraction proves that wavelength of light is smaller than that of sound. Polarization \u00b6 Confinement of electric vectors of light into one plane is called polarization. The material, which produces polarization, crystal is called polarizer. e.g. tourmaline Polariod (polarizer) absorbs all magnetic vectors as well as randomly oriented electric vectors leaving only those electric vectors, which are in one plane. Tourmaline crystal has internal molecular structure such that their interaction with incident light is to: Absorb all magnetic vectors Put (confine) all electric vector in one plane. Polarization is possible only in e.m waves because their electric and magnetic vectors are perpendicular to each other as well as well to direction of propagation polarization Thus polarization has established that light is a transverse wave. Analyzer is used to test plane polarization. Plane determined by direction of propagation and polarized electric vectors of light is called plane of polarization. Malus Law : $$ I = I_o\\cos^2\\theta $$ Different methods for producing plane polarized light are given below: Selective absorption technique (e.g. tourmaline crystal, calcite, crystal) Polarization by reflection. Polarization by scattering. Intensity of Light Emerging from Polariod. \u00b6 Intensity is given as $$ I = I_o\\cos^2\\theta $$ If the two polaroids have their transmission axes parallel to each other, i.e, \\(\\theta' = \\theta^o\\) $$ I = I_o\\cos^2\\theta = I_o(\\text{max}) $$ If the two polaroids are crossed, i.e., have their transmission axes perpendicular to each other, \\(\\theta = 90^o\\) $$ I = I_o\\cos^2(90) = 0(min) $$ Uses of Polarized Light \u00b6 Determination of concentration of optically active substance in a solution, eg sugar in blood & urine by using polarimeter in medical diagnostic labs. Curtainless window. To enhance effect of clouds & sky in photograph. Headlights of vehicles to control the glare in night driving.","title":"09 - Physical Optics"},{"location":"physics/ch09/#physical-optics","text":"","title":"Physical Optics"},{"location":"physics/ch09/#wave-front-and-rays","text":"Wave front is a locus of points which have same phase of vibrations.

An electric force is the force which holds the positive and negative charges the make up atoms, molecules and bodies. Charges & its Relationship with Friction \u00b6 Bodies get charge due to friction. During rubbing process, free or atomic electrons gain more energy and get detached thus producing positive charge. Similar charges repel each other and opposite charges attract each other . Excess of electrons create negative charge while deficiency produces positive charge in an object. SI unit of charge is coulomb. it is defined as: Coulomb If force between two equal and opposite charges placed in a vacuum 1 m apart is \\(9\\times10^9N\\) then each of them bear 1C charge.

Charge per unit volume \\((\\Delta Q/\\Delta V)\\) is called Volume charge density Charge per unit length \\((\\Delta Q/\\Delta L)\\) of straight conductor is called linear charge density . When charged particle is subjected to electrical field, then its acceleration is \\(qE/m\\) . When charge particle is given to hollow sphere, it resides on outer surface only but not on inner surface. We can charge a particle by two methods: Induction (without physical contact). Conduction (with physical contact). Electrical Forces \u00b6 Coulomb found that electrical force between two point charges is: Directly proportional to product of magnitude of the charges.

Info Two charges are always taken as point charges because they are very small in size as compared to the distance between them. Electric Field \u00b6 Electric Field is a vector quantity. It is intrinsic property of charge to have electric field around it. Two theories has been put forward to explain electric field: Action at a distance (Newton's view) Field theory (Faraday's view) Action-at-distance has been rejected experimentally while field theory is a convincing view. For infinite extent, field is uniform all over. For finite extent, field is not uniform at ends. (Fringing Field) Electric Intensity \u00b6 Electric Intensity is given as: $$ E = F / q_{\\omicron} $$ Where \\(q_{\\omicron}\\) is a test charge. it is defined as the force per unit positive charge. In vector form $$\\overline{E} = k \\frac{q}{r^2} \\hat{r} $$ for point charge. SI unit of \\(E\\) is \\(N/C\\) and \\(V/m\\) Electric Field Lines \u00b6 The path followed by a tiny positive charge in an electrical field are called Electric Field Lines. Originate from positive charge. End on negative charge. Do not intersect Contract longitudinally. Repel transversely. No electrical line is present inside the conductor. Tangent drawn to electric lines gives the direction of electric intensity. Electric Field is stronger where the electric lines are closely packed Applications of Electrostatics \u00b6 Xerography (Photocopier) \u00b6 \"Xeros\" means \"dry\", \"graphy\" means \"writing\" The lamp transfers the image of document as bright and dark spots on drum Drum is an aluminum cylinder coated with selenium. Selenium is a LDR. It retains positive charge in dark. Positive charge document image is created on the drum. Toner is given negative charge and is sprayed over the drum. The image is then transferred on paper and is settles by the heated pressure roller. Inkjet Printers \u00b6 It works on the thin stream of ink ejected from the nozzle at high speed. It passes through two electrical components. Charging electrode and deflecting plates . Charging electrode gives a net charge to the stream controlled by instructions from computer. The uncharged drops pass without deflection through deflection plates and strike the paper while charged drops are directed to gutter. Electric Flux \u00b6 Electric Flux is the number of electric lines of force passing perpendicular through certain area. Mathematically, $$ \\phi_e = \\overline{E} \\cdotp \\overline{A} = EA \\cos \\theta $$ provided \\(\\overline{E}\\) is uniform on the flat surface represented by \\(\\overline{A}\\) . Its Scalar quantity. Flux is maximum when \\(\\theta=0^{\\circ}\\) (surface is perpendicular) Flux is zero when \\(\\theta=90^{\\circ}\\) (surface is parallel) If no. of flux lines leaving a closed surface is greater than no. of flux lines entering then surface contains source or positive charge. If no. of flux lines leaving a closed surface is less than no. of flux lines entering then surface contains sink or negative charge. If no. of flux lines leaving a closed surface is equal to no. of flux lines entering then surface contains neither sink nor source. Info Electric flux depends upon charge and medium not on the shape of the closed surface Flux Through Closed Surface \u00b6 Flux through closed surface is: $$ \\phi_e = Q / \\epsilon_{\\omicron} $$ It shows that flux through closed surface is independent of location of charges enclosed by it and shape of closed surface. Question Any apparatus placed within a metal enclosure is shielded from electric field. Why? Gauss's Law \u00b6 The flux through a closed surface is \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{\\omicron}}\\right)\\) times the total charge enclosed in it. Mathematically $$ \\phi_{total} = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{\\omicron}}\\right)Q $$ Gauss's Law is applied to calculate electric intensity. for this purpose an imaginary closed surface called Gaussian Surface is considered which must pass through the point at which the electric intensity is to be evaluated. Applications \u00b6 Electric intensity inside a hollow but uniformly charges sphere is zero \\(E = 0\\) Electric intensity due to infinite sheet of charge is given as: $$ \\overline{E} = \\frac{\\sigma}{2\\epsilon_{\\omicron}}\\hat{r} $$ Electric intensity between two equal but oppositely charged plates is given by $$ \\overline{E} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon_{\\omicron}}\\hat{r} $$ Electric Potential & Potential Difference \u00b6 Work done per unit positive charge in moving it against electric field with uniform velocity i.e. keeping the charge in electrostatic equilibrium. Mathematically $$ \\Delta V = \\frac{W_{A\\rightarrow B}}{q_{\\omicron}} $$ It can be given in term of potential energy as $$ \\Delta V = \\frac{\\Delta U}{q_{\\omicron}} $$ where \\(W_{A\\rightarrow B}=\\Delta U =\\) electrostatic P.E. SI unit of potential difference is volt. If 1J of work is done on one coulomb charge between two points keeping the equilibrium, the potential difference is 1V. $$ 1V = 1J / 1C $$ Info We can relate electric potential difference and electric field intensity by following relation: \\(E=-\\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta r}\\) Where negative sign shows that E is along decreasing potential \\(N/C\\) is equal to \\(V/m\\) . It means that: We can call \\(E\\) as potential gradient because it represents the maximum rate of change of potential difference w.r.t displacement. SI unit of \\(E\\) is \\(N/C\\) is equivalent to \\(V/m\\) . Absolute electric potential at a distance \\(r\\) from source is given as: $$ V = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{\\omicron}}\\cdotp\\frac{q}{r} $$ Absolute electric potential at a point due to collection of point charges is given by $$ V = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{\\omicron}}\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n\\frac{q_i}{r_i} $$ ECG records the voltage between points on human skin generated by electric process in the heart while EEG records that by brain. Equipotential Surfaces \u00b6 The surface on which electric potential is same at each of its points. Example Surface charged hollow sphere containing point charge at its center Characteristics of Equipotential Surfaces \u00b6 They do not intersect Potential difference between two points on equipotential surface is zero No work is done to move a point charge on an equipotential surface. Work is done when point charge is moved from one equipotential surface to another. Electron Volt \u00b6 The amount of energy acquired or lost by an electron as it traverses a potential difference of one volt \\(1eV=1.6\\times10^{-19}J\\) \\(1J=6.25\\times10^{18}eV\\) It is the unit of energy specially used for atomic particles.

Minimum quantum charge of electron is \\(1.6\\times10^{-19}C\\) . Capacitor & Capacitance \u00b6 Capacitor is a device used for storing electric charge and electrical energy. Charge stored by capacitor is given by: $$ Q=CV $$ Where \\(C\\) is the capacitance of capacitor. Capacitance is defined as: Ability of a capacitor to store charge. OR The ratio of charge stored to the potential difference between plate of capacitor. $$ C=\\frac{Q}{V} $$ SI unit of capacitance is Farad . 1 Farad is defined as: The capacitance of capacitor is one farad if a charge of one coulomb, given to one of the plate of parallel plate capacitor, produces a potential difference of one volt between them. $$ 1F= \\frac{1C}{1V} $$ Capacitance of parallel plate capacitor with air between its plates as: $$ C_{vac}= \\epsilon_{\\omicron}\\frac{A}{d} $$ The above expression shows that: As we increase the area of plate the capacitance will increase. Decreasing the distance between the plates will increase the capacitance. Introducing a dielectric between the plates will increase the capacitance of the capacitor. Capacitor of an isolated charge sphere of radius \\(R\\) is $$ C= 4\\pi\\epsilon_{\\omicron} R $$. Capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor with dielectric between its plate is given by: $$ C_{med}= \\epsilon_r \\epsilon_{\\omicron} \\frac{A}{d}= \\epsilon_rC_{vac}\\;\\; \\implies \\;\\; C_{med}>C_{vac} $$ Types of capacitor \u00b6 Parallel Plate Capacitor Spherical Capacitor Miniature Capacitor Tubular Capacitor Paper Capacitor Electrolytic Capacitor Variable Capacitor Dielectric Coefficient/Constant \u00b6 The ratio of the capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor with an insulating substance as medium between the plates to its capacitance with vacuum as medium. $$ \\epsilon_r=\\frac{c_{med}}{C_{vac}} $$ Charging of capacitor is due to electrostatic induction phenomenon. Old name of capacitor is condenser. Combinations of Capacitors \u00b6 Series Grouping Parallel Grouping Capacitor are said to be connected in series between two points when we can proceed from one point to the other only through one path The capacitors are said to be connected in parallel between any two points if we proceed from one point to the other along different paths. In series grouping charge on each capacitor remains same and equals to the main charge supplied by the battery but potential difference across them may or may not be same. In parallel grouping potential difference while charge on them may or may not be same. Charge on each capacitor remains same and equals to the main charge supplied by battery. $$ V= V_1+V_2+V_3 $$ Potential difference across each capacitor remains same and equals to the main potential difference supplied by battery. $$ Q= Q_1+Q_2+Q_3 $$ Equivalent capacitance $$ \\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \\frac{1}{C_{1}} + \\frac{1}{C_{2}} + \\frac{1}{C_{3}} $$ Equivalent capacitance $$ C_{eq} = C_1 +C_2+C_3 $$ In series combination potential difference and energy distribution is in the reverse ratio of capacitance. \\(V \\propto \\frac{1}{C}\\) and \\(\\text{P.E}\\propto\\frac{1}{C}\\) In parallel combination charge and energy distribution in the ration of capacitance. \\(Q\\propto C\\) and \\(\\text{P.E} \\propto C\\) If n identical capacitors each having capacitance \\(C\\) connected in series with supplied voltage \\(V\\) then equivalent capacitance \\(C_{eq}=\\frac{C}{n}\\) If n identical capacitors are connected in parallel \\(C_{eq}=nC\\) Electric Polarization \u00b6 Polarization is a phenomenon of appearance of charges on surface of the material subjected to electric field. Polarization charges are called induced charges. Dipole is a set of two equal and opposite charges separated by a small distance \\(r\\) . Some substances are polar i.e. they have permanent dipoles e.g. in \\(\\text{NaCl}\\) , the end with \\(\\text{Na}\\) ion is positive while that with \\(\\text{Cl}\\) ion is negative. Some substances are non-polar i.e. they do not have permanent dipoles e.g. plastic. They become Polarization temporarily when subjected to external field. Polar molecules experience torque when subjected to uniform electric field but zero the force. In non-uniform electric field it also experience net force in addition to torque. Dielectric \u00b6 Dielectric are non-polar insulators. Polarized dielectrics produce electric field opposite to the applied field. Molecular view of a polarized dielectric is shown below: Where \\(k=\\epsilon_r\\) It shows that a static equilibrium exists within the dielectric Info Value of \\(\\epsilon_r\\) for all doelectrics is greater than 1 expect for air.

The electrons in the dielectric remains bounded to their respective atoms. They just displaced from their normal positions. The molecules of the dielectric under the action of electric field become dipoles and dielectric is polarized. As \\(E=\\sigma/\\epsilon_{\\omicron}\\) , so electric field between Capacitor plates decreases due to polarization of dielectric. Decreases in \\(E\\) decreases the potential difference because \\(V=Ed\\) . As a result capacitance increases. Energy Stored in a Capacitor \u00b6 Charge on the plate of capacitor possesses electrical potential energy because of the work done to deposit the charge on the plates. \\(\\text{P.E} = \\frac{1}{2}qV\\) \\(\\text{Energy in capacitor}=\\) \\(\\frac{1}{2}CV^2=\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{q^2}{C}\\) Energy is stored in electric field between the plates. \\(\\text{Energy} =\\) \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\left[ \\frac{A\\epsilon_r\\epsilon_{\\omicron}}{d}\\right] (Ed)^2\\) \\(\\text{Energy density} =\\) \\(\\text{Energy}/\\text{Volume}\\) \\(= \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon_r\\epsilon_{\\omicron}E^2\\) Info For D.C capacitor behaves as open circuit. For A.C capacitor behaves as closed circuit. Charging and Discharging a Capacitor \u00b6 D.C supply stores charges on the plate A.C supply does not store charge. Charging and discharging time depends upon product of \\(R\\) & \\(C\\) . Time Constant \u00b6 $$ t=RC $$ its unit is \\(s\\) (second). Time constant is defined as the time required by a capacitor to charge up to 0.63 times equilibrium charge on the capacitor. $$ t=0.63q_{\\omicron} $$ charge reaches its equilibrium value sooner when time constant is smaller.

Terminal Potential difference is a voltage between out put terminals of a source of emf when current is drawn from it We can relate emf ( \\(\\varepsilon\\) ), terminal potential ( \\(V_t\\) ) and internal resistance ( \\(r\\) ) by the following equation: $$ \\frac{\\varepsilon}{V_t} = \\frac{V_t+I_t}{\\varepsilon-I_t} $$ Info There are fwe relations for comaring \\(V_t\\) and \\(E\\) . \\(V_t=\\varepsilon\\) if \\(I=0\\) (open circuit) \\(V_t=\\varepsilon\\) if \\(r=0\\) \\(V_t<\\varepsilon\\) by a factor \\(Ir\\) except when one battery charged the other emf is \"cause\" & potential difference is its \"effect\".

Study of magnetic properties associated with Electricity and laws relating them is called Electromagnetism. Iron ore \"Magnetite ( \\(Fe_3O_4\\) )\" was discovered as early as 600 BC from Magnesia, a region in Asia Minor, situated in modern Turkey. Ore magnet was named \"Lodestone\" meaning leading stone, having directional property. Magnetic field arises due to moving electric charges like in atoms or in conducting materials. Characteristics of a Magnet \u00b6 It has two poles. North Pole of magnet coincide with south pole of earth's magnet and vice versa. Magnetism at poles is greater than at middle. Like poles attract while unlike poles repel each other. Freely suspended magnet sets itself along N-S direction. Info Poles of magnet can't be separated i.e If large magnet is cut into two parts each part will be a complete magnet in itself having both N and S poles. An un-magnetized magnetic material can be magnetized as follows: By electric method (passing strong DC) By single touch or double touch methods. Magnet can be demagnetized as follow: By passing AC BY heating strongly By striking a magnet again and again with surface like that of earth e.g by hammering with hammer. Magnetic Field \u00b6 Magnetic field is a region around a magnet within which it can exert its influence upon a magnetic material. Magnetic field consists of lines of magnetic force having following properties: Two magnetic lines of force can't intersect each other. Magnetic lines of force fill whole space around a magnet. Magnetic lines of force emerge from N and end on S. The no of magnetic lines at a point gives strength of magnetic field. Longitudinally they tend to shorten their length. It explains attraction between opposite poles. Transversely they repel each other. It explains the repulsion between two like poles. Direction of magnetic field of the current is found by right hand rule for positive charges or conventional current Magnetic Field Due to Current in Straight Wire \u00b6 Hans Oersted found that a magnetic field is set up in the region surrounding current carrying wire. The lines of force are circular and their direction depends upon the direction of current. The magnetic field lasts only as long as the current is flowing through the wire. Right Hand rule \u00b6 If the wire is grasped in fist of right hand with the thumb pointing in the direction of the conventional current, the fingers of the hand will circle the wire in the direction of the magnetic field. Following figures should be kept in mind about direction of magnetic field. Magnetic Field & Magnetic force \u00b6 Origin of magnetism is motion of charges, was found by Oersted. Force on a Moving Charge in a Magnetic Field \u00b6 In an experiment with bar magnet and field produced by charges flowing in a wire (current), following results are drawn: If \\(v||B\\) , then \\(F=0\\) . If \\(v\\bot B\\) , then \\(F=\\text{max}\\) . \\(F\\bot v\\) and \\(F\\bot B\\) means \\(F\\) is normal to the plane containing \\(v\\) and \\(B\\) . \\(\\overline{F}=q(\\overline{v}\\times\\overline{B})\\) Magnetic field can be given as $$ B=\\frac{F}{qv\\sin\\theta} $$ Magnetic Field Strength Magnetic force acting on a unit charge entering perpendicularly through a magnetic field with speed of \\(1m/s\\) is called magnetic field strength .

Force on a Current Carrying conductor in a Uniform Magnetic Field \u00b6 Current carrying conductor experiences a force when placed in a Uniform Magnetic Field that is given by $$ \\overline{F}=I(\\overline{L}\\times\\overline{B}) $$ Where \\(L\\) is length of conductor inside the magnetic field and defined along the direction of conventional current. Drift speed of an electron in a conductor is given as: $$ v_d = \\frac{1}{nAe} $$ Magnetic field can be given as: $$ B=\\frac{F}{IL\\sin\\theta} $$ Magnetic field Magnetic force acting on a conductor of \\(1m\\) carrying \\(1A\\) current and placed \\(\\bot\\) to magnetic field.

Question Is it possible that we keep increasing the number of turns of coil but the magnetic field strength remains constant? Yes. Why? Solenoid & Toroid \u00b6 Solenoid is a cylindrical coil wound on a magnetic or non-magnetic material called core. When current flows through a solenoid, the magnetic field is produced inside as well as outside it. Field of solenoid behaves as a bar magnet. Toroid is a solenoid bent into the form of a circle. Field of toroid is in the form of circular lines of force. Force on Charge Particle in an Electric & Magnetic Field \u00b6 As, \\(F_e=qE\\) and \\(F_m=q(v\\times B)\\) So, \\(F= F_e+F_m\\) $$ F=qE+q(v\\times B) $$ where F is called Lorentz Force . Electric force does work. Magnetic force does no work. Motion of a Charged Particles in a Magnetic Field \u00b6 When a narrow beam of electron moving with constant speed \\(v\\) be projected at right angles to a known uniform magnetic field \\(B\\) directed into plane of paper, the electrons experiences force at right angle to their direction and they will start moving in a circular path. \\(F_c=F_m\\) \\(\\frac{mv^2}{r}=qvB\\) \\(mv=qBr\\) \\(r=\\frac{mv}{qB}=\\frac{p}{qB}\\) where \\(p\\) is the momentum of particle. Magnetic force can do no work on the charged particle entering magnetic field because \\(F_m \\bot v\\) (always). Time period of charges particle subjected to circular motion in a magnetic field is given as: \\(T=\\text{circumference}/\\text{velocity}\\) \\(\\;\\;=2\\pi R/v\\) \\(\\qquad\\) \\(=2\\pi mv/qBv\\) \\(\\;\\;=2\\pi m/qB\\) * frequency pf charged particle circulating in a magnetic field is given as: $$ f=qB/2\\pi m $$ It is known as cyclotron frequency . * If a particle has both components of velocity \\(v_{\\bot}\\) and \\(v_{||}\\) and is allowed to enter magnetic field, it adopts helical motion. Force at \\(90\\degree\\) to the velocity, changes direction and not the speed of the particle. e/m Ratio \u00b6 e/m of a charged particle can be given as $$ \\frac{e}{m}=\\frac{v}{Br} $$ where \\(r\\) is determined by Thomson's apparatus while velocity is determined by following two methods. Potential difference method $$ v=\\sqrt{2V\\frac{e}{m}} $$ Thus $$ \\frac{e}{m}=\\frac{2V}{B^2 r^2} $$ Where \\(V\\) is P.D, \\(B\\) is magnetic field & \\(r\\) is radius. Velocity selector method $$ v=\\frac{E}{B} $$ Thus $$ \\frac{e}{m}=\\frac{E}{B^2r} $$ The value of \\(e/m\\) is equal to \\(1.758\\times10^{11}C/kg\\) Question The \\(e/m\\) of a proton is greater or less than an electron? Cathode Ray Oscilloscope (CRO) \u00b6 IT is a high-speed graph-plotting device same as picture tube of TV set or monitor of a computer. Electron beam is produced and deflected by voltage. Fluorescent screen make it visible. A grid is used to control the number of electrons. The grid is at a negative potential with respect to cathode. Electrons are accelerated by anode. CRO is used for displaying the waveform of given voltage. Once the waveform is displayed, we can measure the voltage, its frequency and phase. Torque \u00b6 A current carrying coil placed in magnetic field, will be rotated, in magnetic field producing torque. $$ \\tau=BINA \\cos\\alpha $$ where \\(\\alpha\\) is the ngle made by the plane with magnetic field. \\(N\\) is the number of turns of coil. \\(A\\) is the area of the coil. 1 image missing Electrical Measuring Instruments \u00b6 Electrical measuring instruments are those devices, which convert electrical energy to mechanical energy. Info All the electrical measuring instruments can only read current because current is the characteristic that can be measured as it can show physical effects. So all measuring instruments show different scaled only but they are measuring current e.g a voltmeter can measure voltage but actually it measures current and display it on the scale of volts. Examples \u00b6 Galvanometer Voltmeter Ammeter AVO meter Galvanometer (GM) \u00b6 Galvanometer is used for the direction of both AC and DC & voltages. Galvanometer is a parent instrument, which can be converted into voltmeters and ammeters etc. Principle \u00b6 Current carrying coil experiences electric torque \\(\\tau=BINA\\cos\\alpha\\) , when placed in magnetic field. Types \u00b6 Moving coil Galvanometer Moving magnet Galvanometer Major parts of moving coil GM \u00b6 pole piece made concave. suspension wire lamp scale arrangement coil hair spring Working moving coil GM \u00b6 When coil of GM stops after deflection, then $$ \\text{Deflecting torque} = \\text{Restoring torque} $$ $$ BINA\\cos\\alpha=c\\theta $$ Here \\(\\alpha=0\\) , $$ I=\\frac{c\\theta}{BAN} = k\\theta $$ where \\(c\\) represents couple per unit twist or torsion constant that depends upon the nature and geometry of suspension wire. Galvanometer constant is given as: $$ K=\\frac{c}{BAN} $$ According to above equation, the Galvanometer can be made sensitive by: Increasing the length and decreasing the diameter of suspension wire. \\(B,A,N\\) are made large. Best is to make \\(B\\) as strong as possible. Info The needle of the galvanometer should stop quickly at the mean position, thus should suffer lesser oscillations. So the galvanometers are designed such that these oscillations can be minimized. So they are critically damped. Such type of galvanometer is called dead head galvanometer . Modifications is Weston-type Galvanometer \u00b6 Suspension wire is replaced by shaft with pivot. Lamp-scale arrangement is replaced by light aluminum needle and graduated scale. Ammeter \u00b6 Galvanometer is used to measure current when converted into ammeter. Galvanometer can be converted into AM by connecting a shunt (low resistance) in parallel to its coil. Value of shunt is given as: $$ R=\\fraC{I_g R_g}{I-I_g} $$ where \\(I\\) is called range. To increase the range of Ammeter, shunt resistance should be made more small. Range of Ammeter is given by: $$ =I_g\\left[\\frac{I+R_g}{R_s}\\right] $$ Ammeter is always connected in series. An Ammeter must have very low resistance so that it does not disturb the circuit resistance. Voltmeter \u00b6 Voltmeter is high resistance Galvanometer To convert Galvanometer into Voltmeter, a high resistance \\(R_h\\) is connected in series with its coil. High resistance, which converts Galvanometer into Voltmeter is given by $$ R_h=\\frac{V}{I_g}-R_g $$ where \\(V\\) is called range of voltmeter . Range of voltmeter is given by $$ V= I_g(R_g+R_h) $$ It shows that \\(V\\propto R_h\\) so making resistance \\(R_h\\) higher can make a Voltmeter more sensitive Voltmeter is always connected in parallel. Reading of Voltmeter is not accurate as it draws some current for its working. Hence it measures less voltage than actual. For accurate measurement of voltage, potentiometer is used. Ohm Meter \u00b6 Rapidly measures resistances. Adjustable resistance along with cell is used internally in ohmmeter. Adjustable resistance is called limiting resistance AVO meter \u00b6 It is used for measurement of current, voltage & resistance. A for Amp V for voltage O for Ohm No of scales on AVO meter are three: Ohm Scale Current Scale both for AC & DC Voltage Scale both for AC & DC As Ohmmeter \u00b6 Circuit is given below: As Voltmeter \u00b6 Set of resistances connected in series to coil of Galvanometer is called multiplier Circuit is given below: As Ammeter \u00b6 Set of shunts connected in parallel is called Universal Shunt or Aryton Digital Multimeter (DMM) \u00b6 It is AVO meter but have digital display . It is gives decimal counting, polarity and unit for \\(V, A\\) or \\(\\omega\\) It is free from human errors of polarity selection .","title":"14 - Electromagnetism"},{"location":"physics/ch14/#electromagnetism","text":"Study of magnetic properties is called magnetism.

Energy Stored in an Inductor \u00b6 Inductor is simply an insulated coil that offers very small resistance to DC current but offers high resistance to AC current. In case of capacitor, energy is stored in electric field between the plates. Similarly, energy is stored in magnetic field of the inductor. Work done by the battery to move charges against the induced EMF is $$ W=\\frac{1}{2}LI^2 $$. This work is stored as potential energy in the inductor as $$ U=\\frac{1}{2}LI^2 $$ Also \\(L=\\mu_o n^2 Al\\) $$ U=\\frac{1}{2}(\\mu_o n^2 Al)I^2 $$ As, \\(B=\\mu_o nl\\) Then, $$ U=\\frac{1}{2} B^2 \\frac{Al}{\\mu_o} $$ As, \\(Al=\\text{Volume}\\) Then energy density is $$ =\\frac{U}{Al}= \\frac{IB^2}{2\\mu_o} $$ OR $$ =\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{B^2}{\\mu_o} \\implies U\\propto B^2 $$ Inductor in an AC circuit always resists the abrupt change in current.

Principle \u00b6 EMF is induced across a coil rotating in a magnetic field due to change of magnetic flux. Main Parts \u00b6 Pole Pieces (U-Shape magnet) with concave poles. Armature (assembly of coil on iron cylinder) Slip rings (as connector) Carbon brush (external supply) Working \u00b6 EMF is induced by the side of loop intersecting the magnetic field. Total EMF for N number of loops is given as: $$ \\epsilon=N(2vB\\sin \\theta) \\;\\;\\; \\text{also} \\;\\;\\; \\epsilon=N\\omega AB sin \\omega t$$ $$ \\epsilon_{max}=N\\omega AB \\;\\;\\; \\text{when} \\;\\;\\; \\theta = 90\\degree $$ So, $$ \\epsilon=\\epsilon_{max}\\sin \\omega t $$ if \\(\\omega=2\\pi f\\) then $$ \\epsilon=\\epsilon_{max} \\sin 2\\pi ft $$ In terms of potential difference, \\(V=V_o\\sin 2\\pi ft\\) In terms of current \\(I=I_o\\sin 2\\pi ft\\) where f is the frequency with which the direction of current is changing. In Pakistan \\(f=50Hz\\) , it means 50 times in a second direction is changed. In DC generator split rings or commutators, inverted by William Sturgeon are used in place of slip rings. DC generator produce uni-directional pulsating DC, not pure DC. For pure Dc many coils are wound around cylindrical core. Back Motor Effect in Generator \u00b6 The device in electric circuit that consumes electric energy is known as load . The greater the load, the larger the current is supplied by the generator. When the circuit is closed, a current is drawn through the coil. The magnetic field exerts force on the current carrying coil. This force produces a counter torque that opposes the rotational motion of coil. This effect is called back motor effect of generator. According to law of conservation of energy, the energy consumed by the load must come from the energy source used to drive turbines. The larger the current drawn by the load, the greater is the counter torque produced. DC Motor \u00b6 A motor is a device which converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. * A generator running backward is called motor. * Principle of motor is that whenever a current carrying coil is placed in a magnetic field it experiences a couple of forces, which causes torque. Back EMF Effect in Motor \u00b6 The self induced emf ( \\(\\epsilon\\) ) in a motor opposes the voltage \\(v\\) running the motor. Thus induced emf is called the back emf of motor. The magnitude of back emf increases with the speed of motor. \\(V\\) & \\(\\epsilon\\) are in opposite polarity. Current flowing in motor is: $$ I=\\frac{(V-\\epsilon)}{R} \\;\\; \\implies \\;\\; V=\\epsilon + IR $$ As the motor speeds up, the back emf increases and the current become smaller and smaller. So current should be kept sufficient to provide torque. If motor is overloaded, the back emf decreases and allow the motor to draw more current. If motor is overloaded beyond its limits, the current could be so high that it may burn the motor coil. Transformer \u00b6 Transformer is an electromagnetic device used to step up or step down AC voltage or AC current, not DC. Principle of transformer is the mutual induction . Coil of transformer where input is applied is called primary coil while other where output is obtained is called secondary coil. Core consist of laminated punched sheets of sotf iron on which coil is wound. Lamination of core is done to reduce eddy current losses (eddy current is and induced current produced in a core). Transformer can not step up or step down the energy or power. Transformer consumes very little part of input power so it can kept running hours without considerable loss of power. $$ \\frac{V_s}{V_p} =\\frac{N_s}{N_p}= \\frac{I_p}{I_s} $$ Info Transformer is one of the static devices in the electrical appliances. So there is no loss of energy in friction. Hence they can have higher efficiencies. We can achieve up to 95% efficient transformer. Energy Losses \u00b6 Copper Losses in winding: Due to resistance of the winding of primary and secondary coil, some electrical energy is always lost in form of heat energy. Flux Losses: The coupling of the primary and secondary is never perfect and whole of magnetic flux produced in the primary coil does not link the secondary coil. This results in some energy loss. Iron losses in core: Iron losses are of two types: Eddy Current Loss: Due to the periodically varying nature of AC supplied in primary, the flux associated with core changes and therefore, eddy currents are induced in it. Eddy currents induced in the core are undesirable as they heat the core and result in energy loss. To minimize the eddy current losses, core is laminated. Hysterisis Loss: The alternating current flowing through the coils magnetized and demagnitizes the iron core again and again. therefore, during each cycle of magnetizatio, same energy lost due to hysterisis. To minimize this loss we choose material of core of smaller hysterisis loss generally soft iron. Efficiency of Transformer \u00b6 Ideal transformer efficiency is 100% or 1 but in actual tranformer output power is always less than inout power, so efficincy also always less than 100%. In general efficiency of transformer is very high and of the order of 90%. Efficiency is given by: $$ \\eta =\\frac{\\text{Output Power}}{\\text{Input Power}}\\times 100 $$ In terms of secondary and primary voltage and current $$ \\eta = \\frac{V_sI_s}{V_pI_p} $$ As, \\(\\text{Imput}=\\text{Output} + \\text{Losses}\\) so, $$ \\eta =\\frac{\\text{Output Power}}{\\text{Output Power} + \\text{Losses}} $$ Applications \u00b6 They are used in power distribution in a safe from power stations to the utility stations. The principle of transmission is the that we reduce the value of current via increasing the transmission voltage so saving the cost of copper as less think wire can full fill the purpose due to small currents. Transformer also provide a degree of control of electricity distribution to a town.","title":"15 - Electromagnetic Induction"},{"location":"physics/ch15/#electromagnetic-induction","text":"Orested discovered magnetic field due to current carrying coil.

Iron losses in core: Iron losses are of two types: Eddy Current Loss: Due to the periodically varying nature of AC supplied in primary, the flux associated with core changes and therefore, eddy currents are induced in it. Eddy currents induced in the core are undesirable as they heat the core and result in energy loss. To minimize the eddy current losses, core is laminated. Hysterisis Loss: The alternating current flowing through the coils magnetized and demagnitizes the iron core again and again. therefore, during each cycle of magnetizatio, same energy lost due to hysterisis.

Time period \\(T\\) of alternating or voltage (that produced it) is the time interval \\(T\\) in which the source voltage reverses its polarity once. The sinusoidal waveform of AC is a graph between voltage and time.

Example \u00b6 Quartz, mica, sugar, copper sulphate, sodium chloride etc. Properties \u00b6 They have long range symmetry, regular arrangement is extended over a large volume of the crystal. They possess uniform chemical composition. The physical properties like thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, compressibility, refractive index etc, have different values in different directions. They have flat surface. Amorphous Solids \u00b6 The solids in which the atoms are arranged in indefinite, irregular and short range order are said to be amorphous. Example \u00b6 Glass, rubber, sulphur etc. Properties \u00b6 The distribution of atoms or molecules in these solids is random. They are isotropic, ie. they have same physical properties in all directions. Amorphous solids do not have sharp melting points. They have no characteristic geometrical shape. Polymorphic Solids \u00b6 Polymorphic may be said to be more or less solid material with a structure that is intermediate between order and disorder. They can be classified as partially or poorly crystalline solids. Example \u00b6 Polythene, Polystyrene, nylon etc. Properties \u00b6 Polymers form a large group of naturally occurring and synthetic materials. Polymers consist wholly or in part of chemical combinations of carbon with oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and other metallic or non-metallic elements. Plastic and synthetic rubbers are termed 'Polymers' because they are formed by polymerization reactions in which relatively simple molecules are chemically combined into massive long chain molecules or 3D structures. Crystal Lattice \u00b6 A crystal structure is a periodic arrangement of points in space and is obtained by associating with every lattice point a unit assembly or basis of atoms, identical in composition, arrangement and orientation. Elasticity \u00b6 Elasticity: When external forces are applied on a body, which is not free to move, there is a change in its length, volume or shape. When these forces are removed, the body tends to regain its original shape and size. Deforming Force: The external force acting on a body on account of which its size or shape or both changes is defined as the deforming force. Perfectly Elastic Body: If a body completely recovers its original shape and size, it is called, perfectly elastic. Example is quartz. Plastic Body: The body which does not have the property of opposing the external deforming force, is known as a plastic body. The bodies which remain in deformed state ever after removal of the deforming forces are defined as a plastic body. Wet clay is example of plastic body. Note Actually no body is perfectly elastic or perfectly plastic. All bodies behaves in between two limits. We may consider quartz as almost perfectly elastic and putty or wet clay as almost perfectly plastic. Stress \u00b6 The internal restoring force acting per unit are of a deformed body is called stress. Since in equilibrium, the magnitude of the external force is equal to the restoring force stress in equilibrium is measured by the external force per unit area. If a force \\(F\\) is applied on area \\(A\\) , in equilibrium stress \\(=F/A\\) . The stress developed in a body depends upon the way in which external force is applied on the body. Unit of stress in \\(Nm^{-2}\\) and its dimension is \\(ML^{-1}T^{-2}\\) Depending upon, how the external forces are applied on a body, the stress is of three types: Longitudinal Stress \u00b6 When the stress is normal to the surface of the body, then it is known as longitudinal stress. This type of stress is produced due to deformation in length or volume of the body. Longitudinal stress is of two types Tensile stress Compression stress. The longitudinal stress produced due to increase in length or volume of a body is defined as tensile strength. The longitudinal stress, produced due to decrease in length or volume of a body, is defined as compression stress. Volume Stress \u00b6 If equal normal forces are applied on every surface of a body. then it undergoes change in volume. The force opposing this change in volume per unit area of cross-section is defined as volumes stress. It is numerically equal to the applied external force per unit area of cross-section and acts outwards. Shear Stress \u00b6 When the stress is tangential or parallel to the surface of the body then it is known as shear stress. Due to this stress the shape of the body changes or it get twisted. Strain \u00b6 When deforming forces are applied on a body it undergoes a change in shape or size. The fractional (or relative) change in shape or size is called the strain. That is, $$ \\text{Strain}=\\frac{\\text{Change in dimension}}{\\text{Original dimension}} $$ The form of strain depends upon the directions of applied force. Strain is ratio, hence it has no unit and no dimension. Depending upon the way the deforming forces are applied on a body, strain is of three types. Longitudinal (linear) strain \u00b6 It is the ratio of change in length ( \\(\\Delta l\\) ) to the original length ( \\(l\\) ). $$ \\text{Strain}=\\frac{\\text{Change in length}}{\\text{Its original length}} $$ Volume strain \u00b6 It is the ratio of the change in volume ( \\(\\Delta V\\) ) to the original volume $$ \\text{Volume strain}= \\frac{\\Delta V}{V}$$ Shearing strain \u00b6 The angular deformation ( \\(\\theta\\) ) in radians is called shearing strain. Since 0 is small we may write, $$ \\text{Shear strain} = \\theta = \\tan \\theta = \\frac{\\Delta x}{L}$$ Types of Modulus of Elasticity \u00b6 Young's Modules \\(Y\\) Bulk Modulus \\(K\\) Shear Modulus \\(\\eta\\) The ratio of longitudinal stress to the linear strain is called Young's Modulus \\(Y\\) The ratio of normal stress to the volume strain is called bulk modulus \\(K\\) The ratio of the shearing stress to the shearing strain is called the modulus of rigidity \\(\\eta\\) $$ Y=\\frac{\\text{Linear stress}}{\\text{Longitudinal strain}} $$$$ Y=\\frac{FL}{A\\Delta L}=\\frac{mgL}{\\pi r^2\\Delta L} $$ $$ K=\\frac{\\text{Volume stress}}{\\text{Volume strain}} $$ $$ K=\\frac{FV}{A\\Delta V} $$ $$ \\eta=\\frac{\\text{Shear stress}}{\\text{shear strain}} $$ $$ \\eta=\\frac{F/A}{\\theta}=\\frac{F}{A\\theta} $$ Young's modulus of elasticity is numerically equal to that force which when applied on the wire of the unit cross-section, doubles its length. For gases bulk modulus is of two types Isotermal bulk modolus Adiabatic bulk modulus The concept of shear applies only to solids. The reason is that shear forces are required to deform a solid and the solid tends to return to its shear forces are removed. \\(Y\\) is the characteristic property of solid materials only. The value of \\(K\\) is maximum for solids and minimum for gases. Shear modulus does not apply on gases and liquid because gases and liquid do not have a definite shape to return to after deformation. Hooke's Law \u00b6 Within the elastic limits, the stress setup within an elastic body is proportional to the which the body is subjected by the applied external force i.e. $$ \\frac{\\text{Stress}} {\\text{Strain}} =E $$ \\(E\\) is called modulus of elasticity. The value of \\(E\\) depends upon the material of body and not on the values of stress and strain. The value of \\(E\\) , for the same material, are different for different types of strains. The value of \\(E\\) depends upon the type of stress and strain produced rather than their values. Unit of modulus of elasticity is \\(Nm^2\\) or pascal. Its dimensional formula is \\([ML^{-1}T^{-2}]\\) Elastic Limit & Yield Strength \u00b6 When stress is increased continuously, a point A is reached at which the strain increases more, this point is called elastic limit . Beyond elastic limit the material does not return to its original condition when the deforming force is removed. It acquires what is called permanent set . On stressing a point B, is reached at which the material continues to strain without increase in load i.e. the wire begins to flow down the in spite of the same constant load. This point is called yield point . After large strain. It reaches the breaking point D occurs in the material is called breaking stress or fracture stress .

An isolated single atom possesses a number of discrete energy levels that can be occupied by electrons of the atom. Generally the electrons exist in the ground state, when excited electrons can shift to higher energy levels. Usually only the valence electrons can participate in these excitations. An energy state, which cannot be occupied, is forbidden gap. The band formed by a series of energy levels containing, the valence electrons is known as valence band . The valence band may be partially or completely filled up depending upon the nature of the crystal. The next higher permitted band is called as the conduction band . This band may be empty or partially filled. In conduction band the electrons can move freely. Metals have positive temperature coefficient ( \\(\\alpha_t\\) ) of resistance while semiconductors have negative ( \\(\\alpha_t\\) ). Electrical Classification of Solids \u00b6 All solids employed in electrical work may be classified into following three groups: Conductors Insulators Semiconductors Conductors Insulators Semiconductors In the case of a conductor, there will be no forbidden energy gap. The conduction and valence energy bands overlap each other. Obviously, the electrons from the valence band can freely enter the conduction energy band. In case of an insulators, the forbidden energy band is very wide and hence an electron cannot jump across, from the valence energy band to the conduction energy band. Only when a very large amount of energy is supplied, an electron may be able to jumps across the forbidden band. This explains why certain materials which are perfect insulators behave as conductors only at very high temperatures. In case of diamond, the forbidden energy gap is nearly \\(6eV\\) . In the case of semiconductors, the forbidden energy band is comparatively small. For example \\(0.7eV\\) for ( \\(Ge\\) ) and \\(1.1eV\\) for silicon. In these cases, when a small amount of energy is supplied, the electrons can easily jump across the forbidden energy band and reach the conduction energy band. In conductors, charge carries responsible for the conduction of electricity are free electrons . In insulators, no free electrons are available for conduction. Semiconductors has a much smaller energy gap ( \\(E_g\\) ) between the top of the highest filled band (called valence band ) and the bottom of the vacant band just above it called the conduction band . The electrical conductivity of conductors is of the order of \\(10^8\\Omega m^{-1}\\) The electrical conductivity of insulators is very low in the range \\(10^{-16}\\) to \\(10^{-6}\\Omega m^{-1}\\) The conductivity of semiconductors is of the order of \\(1\\Omega m^{-1}\\) Metallic conductors have positive temperature coefficient of resistance. In insulators, the valence band is completely filled while conduction band is completely empty. Semiconductors have negative temperature coefficient of resistance. The resistance of conductor increases due to addition of impurities. Ionic crystal are insulators. The other examples are glass, wood, paper, mica, diamond, ceramic, plastic etc. The resistance of semiconductor decreases due to the addition of impurities. At absolute zero temperature, conduction band is completely behaves as an insulators. Type of Semiconductors \u00b6 There are two types of semiconductors: N-type Semiconductor P-type Semiconductor N-type Semiconductor P-type Semiconductor When a small amount of Pentavalent Impurity (Examples: Phosphorus, antimony etc) is added to an intrinsic semiconductor, we obtain an N-type extrinsic semiconductor. When a small amount or trivalent Impurities (Examples: gallium, Indium, boron, etc) is added to an intrinsic semiconductor, we obtain a P-type extrinsic semiconductor are called acceptor atoms, as they accept an electron from the host lattice. In the N-type semiconductor, the number of electrons in the conduction band > number of holes in the valence band In the P-type semiconductor, the number of holes in the valence band > number of electrons in the conduction band. The impurities atoms in N-type extrinsic semiconductor are called donor atom as they donate as extra electrons to pure semiconductor or host lattice. The impurities in P-type extrinsic semiconductor are called acceptor atoms , as they accept an electron from the host lattice In the N-type semiconductor, electrons are called as majority charge carriers, whereas holes are called minority charge carriers. In P-type semiconductor holes are majority charge carriers while electrons are minority charge carriers. In N-type semiconductor, the Fermi level shift towards the conduction band. There is no charge on P-type semiconductor also, because it is formed by the combination of free positive charged holes and fixed negatively charges acceptor ions. There is no charge on N-type semiconductor because it is formed by the combination of free negatively charges electrons and fixed majority carrier. There is no charge on P-type semiconductor also, because it is formed by the combination of free positively charged holes and fixed negatively charged acceptor. The energy level of the hole can also be calculated approximately using Bohr model. Diamagnetism Paramagnetism Feromagnetism Diamagnetic substances are feebly repelled by the magnet. Paramagnetic substances are feebly attracted by the magnet. Ferromagnetic substances arc strongly attracted by the magnet. Atoms do not have any permanent dipole moment. Atoms have permanent dipole moments which are randomly oriented. Atoms have permanent dipole moments which are organized in domains. Magnetization is small, negative an varies linearly with field. Magnetization is small, positive and varies linearly with field Magnetization is very large, positive and varies non-linearly with field. Susceptibility is small, negative and temperature independent. Susceptibility is small, positive and varies inversely with temperature. Susceptibility is very large, positive and temperature dependent. Relative permeability is slightly greater than unity. Relative Permeability is much greater than unity. This property is exhibited by solids, liquids and gases. This property is exhibited by solids, liquids and gasses. This property is exhibited by solids only that too crystalline. It is practically independent of temperature. It decreases with rise in temperature. It decreases with rise in temperature and above curie temperature become paramagnetic. \\(Bl\\) , \\(Cu\\) , \\(Ag\\) , \\(Hg\\) , \\(Pb\\) , water hydrogen, \\(He\\) , \\(Ne\\) etc are diamagnetic. \\(Na\\) , \\(K\\) , \\(Mg\\) , \\(Mn\\) , \\(Al\\) , \\(Cr\\) , \\(Sn\\) and liquid oxygen are Paramagnetic. \\(Fe\\) , \\(Cc\\) , \\(Ni\\) and their alloys are ferromagnetic. Super Conductors \u00b6 Temperature at which material losses its resistivity and becomes super conductor is called critical temperature. The first super conductor was discovered in 1911. Critical temperature of \\(Al\\) ( \\(T_e=1.18K\\) ), tin ( \\(I_e=3.72K\\) ), lead ( \\(T_e=7.2K\\) ) & Hg( \\(T_e=4.2K\\) ) Complex crystalline structure known as yttrium barium copper Oxide ( \\(YBa_2Cu_3O_7\\) ) is super conductor at \\(163K\\) i.e, at \\(-110\\degree C\\) . Any superconductor with a critical temperature above \\(77 k\\) . the boiling point of liquid nitrogen, is referred as a high temperature superconductor. Uses \u00b6 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Magnetic Levitation trains Powerful but small electric motors Faster computer chips Concentrating \\(U^{235}\\) gas in centrifuge system. Hysteresis Loop \u00b6 Magnetic hysteresis \u00b6 The value of flux density for any value of current is always greater when the current is decreasing, than when it is increasing i.e. magnetism lags behind the magnetizing current. Saturation \u00b6 The magnetic flux density increases from zero and reaches a maximum value. At this stage the material is said to be magnetically saturated. Remanence or Retantivity \u00b6 When the current is reduced to zero, the material still remains strongly magnetized. It is due to the tendency of domains to stay partly in line, once they have been aligned. Coercivity \u00b6 To demagnetize the material, the magnetizing current is reversed and increased to reduce the magnetization to zero; this is known as coercive current. * Once the material is magnetized. its magnetization curve never passes through the origin. * The Coercivity of steel is more than iron, so it requires more current to demagnetize. Area of loop \u00b6 The area of Hysteresis loop is a measure of the energy needed to magnetize. and demagnetize the specimen during each cycle. This is the energy required to do work against internal friction of domains. This work is done against friction, is dissipated as heat. It is called Hysteresis loss. A material with high retentively and large coercive force, would he most suitable to make a permanent magnet.","title":"17 - Physics of Solids"},{"location":"physics/ch17/#physics-of-solids","text":"All solids are made up of atoms and molecules but due to their different internal arrangement of the molecules inside them, they have different classes:","title":"Physics of Solids"},{"location":"physics/ch17/#crystalline-solids","text":"The solids in which the atoms are arranged in definite, regular and long range order are said to be crystalline.","title":"Crystalline Solids"},{"location":"physics/ch17/#example","text":"Quartz, mica, sugar, copper sulphate, sodium chloride etc.","title":"Example"},{"location":"physics/ch17/#properties","text":"They have long range symmetry, regular arrangement is extended over a large volume of the crystal.

In N-region the minority charge carriers are holes while electrons are minority charge carriers in case of P-region. Just after the formation of the junction, the free electrons in the n-region because of their random motion diffuse into p-region. As a result, a charge less region is formed around the junction in which charge Carriers are not present. This region is known as depletion region.

Density of atom is uniform. There is no empty space in the atom. Objections \u00b6 There is no static equilibrium between electron and positive charge. Density of atom is not uniform. Rutherford's Atomic Model \u00b6 Postulates \u00b6 Most of the part of atom is empty. Central part is tiny and positively charged. It is called nucleus. Electrons are revolving about nucleus in circular orbits. Almost whole of mass is concentrated in nucleus (i.e. atom has non-uniform density). Objections \u00b6 The revolving electrons if moving continuously, will emit energy continuously. If energy is emitted continuously, then spectrum should be continuous but a line spectrum is obtained. If energy is emitted continuously, then atomic assembly will collapse Bohr's Atomic Model \u00b6 Postulates \u00b6 Electron can revolve only in those orbits in which its angular momentum is integral multiple of \\(\\frac{h}{2\\pi}\\) $$ mvr =\\frac{nh}{2\\pi} $$ Such orbits are called allowed orbits or stationary state or Bohr's orbits. As long as an electron remains revolving in its allowed orbit, the energy of electron remains constant. When electron jumps down between two allowed orbits, it radiates energy in the form of photon of energy as given by $$ \\Delta E=E_2-E_1=hf $$ Objections \u00b6 Electronic orbits are not circular. Fine structure of atomic spectra could not be explained. Effect of nuclear motion on atomic spectra is not made clear. Nucleus & its Composition \u00b6 Nucleus is a tiny region in which almost all mass of atom is confined. Rutherford thought that whether nucleus is a lump of mass or it is an aggregate of particles. Size of atom is \\(10^{-10}m\\) and that of nucleus is \\(10^{-14}m\\) . According to Rutherford's findings, nucleus is composed of neutron and proton, collectively known as nucleons, symbolized as: \\(_ZX^A\\) Where $$ Z = \\text{no. of electrons or protons in neutral atom} = \\text{charge no.} $$ $$ A = \\text{sum of proton and neutron in a nucleus} = \\text{mass no.} $$ So, $$ \\text{No. of neutron} = N = A - Z $$ In small atom \\(N=Z\\) , while in heavy atom \\(N>Z\\) . Discovery of Nucleons \u00b6 Proton (by Rutherford) $$ _2He^4 +_7N^{14} \\to _8O^{17} + _1H^1 $$ Neutron (by Chadwick) $$ _2He^4 + _4Be^9 \\to _6O^{12} + _on^1 $$ Hydrogen (simple hydrogen) is the only atom whose nucleus contains no neutron. According to modern research, the number of particle ousting in nucleus is 37. Mass of nucleus is roughly equal to sum of masses of nucleons. Unit of mass at atomic level is amu $$ 1 amu = 1.66\\times10^{-27} kg $$ Masses of some well known particles on amu scale are: Particle Symbol Mass in amu Electron \\(_{-1}e^0\\) 0.00055 Proton \\(_1H^1\\) 1.007276 Neutron \\(_on^1\\) 1.008665 Deuteron \\(_1H^2\\) 2.014102 Helium nucleus \\(_2H^4\\) 4.003603 Info We can calculate number of neutrons in a nucleus by simply subtracting mass number and atomic number like: $$ _{92}U^{235} \\to 235-92=143 $$ So this nucleus contains 143 neutrons. \\(1 amu=931 MeV\\) \\(\\;\\;\\;\\) \\(\\implies\\) \\(\\;\\;\\;\\) \\(1.66\\times10^{-27}kg =931MeV\\) Isotopes \u00b6 Isotopes are such nuclei of an element having the same atomic number but different mass number. Isotopes have same number of protons. They have different number of neutrons. Isotopes of an element have the same chemical but different physical properties. Mass Spectrograph \u00b6 Mass spectrograph is an electromagnetic instrument used for the measurement of masses of isotopes. Principle \u00b6 \\[ r\\propto \\sqrt{m} \\] Radius of path described by charges ion is mass spectrometer is given as: $$ r=\\sqrt{\\frac{2Vm}{B^2e}} $$ Where $$ V=\\text{Potential difference} $$ $$ e=\\text{charge} $$ $$ B=\\text{Magnetic field} $$ Mass spectrograph sorts out positive ions. Centripetal forces of the magnetic field provide the isotopes a suitable radius to bend about. Nuclear Forces \u00b6 Nucleus contains protons that repel each other, may cause the destruction of nucleus. There are two classical forces, operating in nucleus. Coulomb's repulsive force: $$ F_{e}=\\frac{K e^2 }{r^2} $$ Newton's attraction force: $$ F_{g} =\\frac{G m^2 }{r^2} $$ Classical forces are unable to give stability to the nucleus. Due to strong repulsive forces in nucleus, it requires much energy for the entry of another charged particles e.g. proton. For Example 7.2 MeV energy is required to the addition of 1 proton into a nucleus of 50 protons A force, which has binding effect on nucleons to give stability of nucleus, is called strong nuclear force. Properties of Strong Nuclear Force \u00b6 It does not obey inverse square law. It is the strongest force having range equal to nuclear diameter 10.14m. It is always attractive force and has binding effect inside the nucleus. Strong nuclear force is attractive only within nucleus while a strong force of repulsion is outside the nucleus because of coulomb's repulsive force. Mass Defect \u00b6 Mass defect is the difference between mass of nucleus and sum of masses of its nucleons. $$ \\Delta m = \\text{sum of masses of nucleons} - \\text{mass of nucleus} $$ e.g. for deuterium ( \\(_{1}H^2\\) ), \\(\\Delta m = 0.002388 amu\\) Mass defect \\(\\Delta m\\) is converted into energy \\(\\Delta mc^2\\) called binding energy. It is liberated in the form of photon. $$ E = Am x 931MeV = [(Z mp - N mp) - m] x 931MeV $$ After liberation of binding energy (E = A mc2), the nucleus becomes stable e.g. BE for deuterium is 2.24 MeV. When energy equal to binding energy is provided to nucleus, somehow, the nucleus dissociates into nucleons. Binding energy can be given as energy required to dissociate nucleus into nucleons. Graph between mass number (A) and B E per nucleon is shown below: The following conclusions can be drawn from the above curve: Binding energy of a light atom is very large that is why they are stable. (max value is at A56). Binding energy of large atoms is smaller that is why they are less stable. The binding energy increases with increasing Atomic mass. Binding energy decreases with increase in atomic mass if atomic number > 82. The binding energy per nucleon is maximum for iron. \\(\\Delta m/A\\) is called packing fraction. Radio Activity \u00b6 Becquerel discovered radioactivity. Nuclei having \\(Z>82\\) are unstable and they emit \\(\\alpha\\) , \\(\\beta\\) or \\(\\gamma\\) rays, this is called radioactivity. Some radioactive elements are \\(_{84}Po\\) , \\(_{88}Rd\\) and \\(_{92}U\\) \\(\\alpha\\) -decay \u00b6 Charge no. ( \\(Z\\) ) decreases by 2 and mass no ( \\(A\\) ) by 4: \\[ _ZX^A \\longrightarrow _{Z-2}Y^{A-4} +_{2}He^{4} + Q \\] For Example $$ _{92}X^{238} \\longrightarrow _{90}Y^{234} + _{2}He^{4} + 4.3 MeV $$ \\(\\beta\\) -particle \u00b6 \\(\\beta\\) -particle is electron or positron coming from nucleus.

The half-life \\(T_{1/2}\\) of a radioactive element is that period in which half of the atoms decay. Half-life ( \\(T_{1/2}\\) ) depends on element and is not affected by any physical change or chemical change. Half-life may be classified as follows: Extremely short half-life: \\(T_{1/2}\\) in micro or nano seconds Moderate half-life: \\(T_{1/2}\\) in minutes. Long half-life: \\(T_{1/2}\\) in years Half life can be given as: $$ T_{1 /2} = 0.693 / \\lambda $$ Where \\(\\lambda\\) is called decay constant depends upon nature of material. Decay constant of any element is equal to the fraction of the decaying atoms per unit time. The unit of the decay constant is \\(s^{-1}\\) . The decay curve shows that radioactive element decay exponentially Half-life is used to identify an atom.

Interaction of nuclear radiations with matter depends on following characteristics of nuclear radiations: * Mass of particle * Charge of particle * Energy of particle * Density of the medium * Ionization potentials of the atoms of the medium Interaction of \\(\\alpha\\) -rays \u00b6 \\(\\alpha\\) -particle can do ionization in following two ways Mechanical collision ( \\(\\alpha\\) -particle directly hits electron) Coulomb's interaction (electrostatic interaction) Mode of ionization by Coulomb's interaction (electrostatic attraction) for \\(\\alpha\\) -rays dominates over that by direct collision. The path of ionization followed by a-rays is straight and continuous because of its high ionization power and large mass. During ionization, \\(\\alpha\\) -particle continuously looses its energy as a result of which its velocity decreases. \\(7.7MeV\\) \\(\\alpha\\) -particle produces \\(2\\times10^5\\) ion pairs before stopping in average. When \\(\\alpha\\) -particle has spent all its energy on ionization it absorbs two electrons from its surroundings gas and becomes a neutral (He atom). Range of \\(\\alpha\\) -particle in air is small due to intense ionization. \\(7.7MeV\\) \\(\\alpha\\) -particle has \\(7cm\\) range in air at S.T. P, which reduces further in denser medium. Range of \\(7.7MeV\\) \\(\\alpha\\) -particle in aluminum is only \\(0.04mm\\) . \\(\\alpha\\) -particle produces disintegration in nuclei of some atoms if they have high energy. Interaction of \\(\\beta\\) -rays \u00b6 \\(\\beta\\) -particles are fast electrons or positrons coming from nucleus. Range of \\(\\beta\\) -particle is larger than that of \\(\\alpha\\) -particle by a factor of 100. Ionization of \\(\\beta\\) -particle is smaller than that of \\(\\alpha\\) . (100 times less) Mass of \\(\\beta\\) -particle is equal to that of an electron. Charge of \\(\\beta\\) -particle is equal to \\(1.6\\times10^{-19}C\\) that may be positive for positron ( \\(\\beta_{+1}^o\\) ) and negative for electron ( \\(\\beta_{-1}^0\\) ). \\(\\beta\\) -Particle does ionization due to electrostatic repulsion (in case of \\(\\beta^-\\) and attraction (in case of \\(\\beta^+\\) ). Ionization path of \\(\\beta\\) is broken and zigzag due to its smaller mass, Ionization by head-on-collision is very rare. \\(\\beta\\) -particle looses almost all its energy in a single encounter. Because of lesser ionization encounters, penetration of \\(\\beta\\) is 100 times than that of \\(\\alpha\\) -particle of same energy. \\(3MeV\\) \\(\\beta\\) -particle can pass through \\(6.5mm\\) aluminum foil. \\(\\beta\\) -particle can produce fluorescence. Interaction of \\(\\gamma\\) -rays \u00b6 \\(\\gamma\\) -rays being photons can't be stopped by matter (lead can be used as a shield because of its high electron density) \\(\\gamma\\) -rays have shorter wavelength than X-rays. \\(\\gamma\\) -particles loose their energy by following three ways. Compton effect Photoelectric effect Pair production. The type of interaction depends upon energy range of photon available according to following scheme: Energy Range Type of Interaction \\(E<0.1 MeV\\) Photoelectric effect \\(E=0.1Mev\\) to \\(1Mev\\) Compton effect \\(E>1.02 MeV\\) Pair Production Interaction of Neutrons \u00b6 Neutrons are more effective radiation than both \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) rays because they bear no charge as regard to penetration. When neutron is captured by a nucleus, it results in the formation of a radioisotope. Neutron causes fission in heavy nuclei.

Wilson cloud chamber is based upon the following principle: Super saturated droplets prefer to condense on ions or dust particles similar to formation of clouds. Construction \u00b6 It consists of a circular base metal plate with hole in the center. Above it, is another metal plate with a black felt pad. A Perspex or glass dome fits over the two plates with the source on its top. Procedure \u00b6 Due to adiabatic expansion, the super-saturated droplets are produced. When nuclear radiation enters, it produces ionization and water vapours condense on such ions. They reflect light to make the path of ionizing particles visible. A high speed camera photographs the track of ionizing particle. Track of ionizing Particle \u00b6 Name of Particle Shape of Track \\(\\alpha\\) -particle Solid & continuous \\(\\beta\\) -particle Zigzag & discontinuous \\(\\gamma\\) -particle No definite track By applying magnetic field, the \\(\\alpha\\) & \\(\\beta\\) particles deviate from its original path. By measuring radii of curvature, we can also measure e/m ratio of \\(\\alpha\\) & \\(\\beta\\) particles. Length of cloud tracks is proportional to energy Geiger-Muller Counter \u00b6 Geiger and Muller invented G.M counter (Geiger - Muller counter). Construction \u00b6 G.M counter consists of a metal tube (cathode) containing inert gas (such as argon & alcohol or bromine and neon) at 0.1 atmospheric pressure. There is a thin win (anode) co-axial with metallic tube. Procedure \u00b6 When nuclear radiation enters, it produces ionization in halogen gas ions. Positive ions move towards negative metallic plate while negative ions towards positive wire. Electrons released by nuclear radiation rush towards the positive wire knocking electrons from atoms of gas in their way. In this way an avalanche of electrons reach the wire and hence current pulse is produced. The current pulse is detected across a resistance of \\(10^9\\Omega\\) . Quenching of Discharge \u00b6 Positive ions on reaching the metal tube pull out electrons. These electrons van excite the atoms, which on returning to ground state emit photons, which than ejects photoelectrons under photoelectric effect, To avoid photoelectrons, We do quenching. Quenching of discharge in G.M counter is attained by following two ways: Manual quenching: by lowering voltage below critical value of discharge. Self-quenching: by adding bromine gas into principal gas (neon) The mechanism is such that the 1:E of bromine is lower than neon, the ions of quenching gas reach the cathode before principal gas ions. When they reach near the cathode, they capture electron and become neutral molecules. Following neutralization, the excess energy of the quenching molecules is dissipated in dissociation of the molecules rather than in the release of electrons from the cathode. G.M counter can be used to study \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\gamma\\) -rays effectively. It can't detect \\(\\alpha\\) -particles. Solid State Detector \u00b6 Solid State detector is most sensitive detector capable of detecting three \\(\\alpha\\) , \\(\\beta\\) & \\(\\gamma\\) -rays. Construction \u00b6 Solid State detector mainly consists of reverse biased diode. Procedure \u00b6 When radiation falls on the diode, it causes the release of electrons, creating some sort of conduction path. The voltage caused due to flow of electrons is measured. Advantages \u00b6 Compact size Very fast detector No need of quenching Portable Can detected \\(\\alpha\\) , \\(\\beta\\) & \\(\\gamma\\) -rays. Low energy utilization (requires \\(3eV - 4eV\\) of energy) Nuclear Fission \u00b6 Otto Hahn and his co-workers discovered nuclear fission accidentally when they were attempting to prepare transuranic elements by bombarding \\(U_{92}^{238}\\) with \\(n_0^1\\) (slow). Transuranic elements are those elements that have atomic no. greater than that of uranium (the heaviest natural element) e.g. Np (Z=93), Pu (Z=94) etc. There are 30 different ways by which nucleus can undergo fission accompanied by 2 to 5 neutrons (average is 2.5 neutrons). Fission neutrons are ejected by daughter or fission fragment, not by parent nucleus. During fission, 99 percent neutrons are ejected in extremely short time and are called prompt neutrons, the remaining 1% are emitted a litter latter. They are called delayed neutrons. Unstable fission fragments, to become stable, eject delayed neutrons. Isotopes of Uranium \u00b6 Ore Percentage Half-life \\(_{92}U^{238}\\) \\(99.38\\) % \\(4.51\\times10^9\\) years \\(_{92}U^{235}\\) \\(0.72\\) % \\(7.04\\times10^8\\) years \\(_{92}U^{234}\\) \\(0.006\\) % \\(2.4\\times10^5\\) years For fission of \\(U^{238}\\) \\(n^1\\) of energy \\(1MeV\\) is required while for \\(U^{235}\\) \\(n^1\\) energy \\(0.04eV\\) is required. Two common fission reactions for uranium are as follows: \\[ _0n^1+_{92}U^{235} \\longrightarrow _{86}Ba^{141} +_{36}Kr^{91}+ 3_0n^1+200MeV(Q) \\] \\[ _0n^1+_{92}U^{235} \\longrightarrow _{54}Xe^{140} +_{38}Sr^{94}+ 2_0n^1+200MeV \\] Types of Fission \u00b6 Controlled fission chain reaction: In this reaction only one neutron, out of all the neutrons created in one fission reaction, becomes the cause of further fission reaction. It is the underlying principal of nuclear reactor. Critical mass: Such a mass of uranium in which one neutron, out of all the neutrons produced in one fission reaction, produces further fission is called critical mass. Uncontrolled fission chain reaction: If the mass of uranium is much greater than the critical mass, then the chain reaction proceeds at a rapid speed and a huge explosion is produced. Atom bomb works at this principal Fermi carried out first controlled fission in 1942. Fission of \\(_{92}U^{235}\\) atom releases \\(10^8\\) times as much energy as is released by atom in ordinary furnace. 1 kg of \\(_{92}U^{235}\\) contains \\(\\implies (1000g/235)\\times 6.023\\times 10^{23}\\) \\(=25.6 \\times 10^{23}\\) atoms. We know that, $$ 1 \\text{ atom of } _{92}U^{238} \\text{ gives } \\implies 200 MeV $$ $$ 1 kg \\text{ of } _{92}U^{235} \\text{gives} \\implies 5.12 \\times 10^{26} MeV $$ We know that, $$ \\text{Time for one fission }= 10^{-8} s $$ $$ \\text{Time for 60 fissions} = 0.6\\mu s $$ Thus \\(5\\times 10^{26}MeV\\) energy is liberated in \\(0.6\\mu s\\) when 1 kg of \\(_{92}U^{235}\\) undergoes, complete fission. Plutonium-239 and uranium-233 are also being used as fuel. Nuclear Reactor \u00b6 Fission chain reaction can be controlled in a device called nuclear reactor. Nuclear reactor works according to the principle that the environment of nuclear reactor is controlled in such a way that only one slow neutron take part in fission process at a time. Parts of Nuclear Reactor \u00b6 Fuel rods: \\(U^{235}\\) is used as fuel. In this fuel of the quantity of \\(U^{235}\\) is increased from 2 to 4%. Control rods: \\(Ba\\) or \\(Cd\\) rods absorb neutrons efficiently. Moderator: to slow down neutrons usually graphite. Heat Exchanger: to convey the energy produced fro the sake of use. Cooling System: to avoid over heating. Core: consists of fuel, control rods and moderator. Biological Shield: to prevent scattering of harmful radiations. Breeding: Breeder nuclear reactor is that which prepare its fuel bu itself. Types of Nuclear Reactors \u00b6 Thermal Reactor \u00b6 Neutrons must be slowed down to thermal energies to provide fission. In this reactor \\(U^{235}\\) is used as fuel. Fast Reactor \u00b6 Fast neutrons are used to strike \\(U^{238}\\) producing \\(Np^{239}\\) and then \\(Pu^{239}\\) . This type of reactor is liquid fast breeder reactor ( LMFBR ) LMFBR produces Plutonium according to following scheme: Thermal Reactor LMFBR Moderator No Moderator Coolant is ordinary water or gas \\(Na\\) is coolant Run continuously Requires maintenance after 15 days Uses \\(U^{235}\\) as fuel Uses \\(U^{238}\\) as fuel","title":"21 - Nuclear Physics"},{"location":"physics/ch21/#nuclear-physics","text":"","title":"Nuclear Physics"},{"location":"physics/ch21/#jj-thomsons-model-of-atom","text":"","title":"JJ Thomson's Model of Atom"},{"location":"physics/ch21/#postulates","text":"Atom is a neutral as a whole, in which negative electrons are embedded on positive nucleus.

Self-quenching: by adding bromine gas into principal gas (neon) The mechanism is such that the 1:E of bromine is lower than neon, the ions of quenching gas reach the cathode before principal gas ions. When they reach near the cathode, they capture electron and become neutral molecules. Following neutralization, the excess energy of the quenching molecules is dissipated in dissociation of the molecules rather than in the release of electrons from the cathode.

Transuranic elements are those elements that have atomic no. greater than that of uranium (the heaviest natural element) e.g. Np (Z=93), Pu (Z=94) etc. There are 30 different ways by which nucleus can undergo fission accompanied by 2 to 5 neutrons (average is 2.5 neutrons). Fission neutrons are ejected by daughter or fission fragment, not by parent nucleus. During fission, 99 percent neutrons are ejected in extremely short time and are called prompt neutrons, the remaining 1% are emitted a litter latter. They are called delayed neutrons. Unstable fission fragments, to become stable, eject delayed neutrons.","title":"Nuclear Fission"},{"location":"physics/ch21/#isotopes-of-uranium","text":"Ore Percentage Half-life \\(_{92}U^{238}\\) \\(99.38\\) % \\(4.51\\times10^9\\) years \\(_{92}U^{235}\\) \\(0.72\\) % \\(7.04\\times10^8\\) years \\(_{92}U^{234}\\) \\(0.006\\) % \\(2.4\\times10^5\\) years For fission of \\(U^{238}\\) \\(n^1\\) of energy \\(1MeV\\) is required while for \\(U^{235}\\) \\(n^1\\) energy \\(0.04eV\\) is required.
