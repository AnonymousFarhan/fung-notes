# Vectors & Equilibrium

## Vectors
A physical quantity which have both magnitude and direction is called a vector quantity.

### Representation of Vectors
* Symbolically, a vector can be represented by
    * An arrow head on top or bottom of a letter. like $\overrightarrow{a}$, $\underrightarrow{a}$
    * A bar on top or bottom like $\overline{a}$, $\underline{a}$
    * Bold face letters like **a**
* Graphically, a vector can be represented by drawing a line and putting arrow head on it.

## Rectangular Coordinate System
### Two dimensional
* It consists of two mutually perpendicular intersecting lines, called x-axis & y-axis
* One angle is enough to specify the direction of a vector in two-dimensional coordinate system.

### Three-dimensional
* It consists of three mutually perpendicular lines called x-axis, y-axis & z-axis
* The direction of a vector in three dimensional rectangular coordinate system is specified by three angles making x, y & z-axis.

## Origin
* It is the point where mutually perpendicular lines in rectangular coordinate system.
* In 2d plane it is $(0,0)$
* In 3d space it is $(0,0,0)$

## Unit Vector
* Unit vector has magnitude of 1.
* It is represented by an hat on them like $\hat{a}$.
* It is used to represent direction of vector.
