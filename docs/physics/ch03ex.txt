1. A particle moves along the x-axis from $x_i$ to $x_f$ which of the following values and final coordinates. which results in the displacement with largest magnitude?
* [ ] $x_i = 4m$, $x_f=-2m$
* [x] $x_i=-4m$, $x_f=4m$
* [ ] $x_i=4m, x_f=6m$
* [ ] $x_i=-4m$, $x_f=-8m$


2. A stone is dripped from the top of a cliff of height $30m$. At the same instant another stone is projected vertically upward, from the ground with a speed of $30m/s$. The two stones will cross each other after a time
* [x] $1s$
* [ ] $2s$
* [ ] $3s$
* [ ] $4s$


3. Which of the following must always be true?

* If an object's acceleration is constant, then it must move in a straight line
* If an object's acceleration is zero, then its speed must remain constant.
* If an object's speed remains constant, then its acceleration must be zero

* [ ] I and II only
* [ ] I and III only
* [x] II only
* [ ] III only


4. A stone is throw n horizontally, with an initial speed of $30m/s$ from a bridge. Find the stone's total speed when it enters the water 4 seconds later. (Ignore air resistance.)
* [ ] $30m/s$
* [ ] $40m/s$
* [x] $50m/s$
* [ ] $60m/s$


5. A baseball is throw vertically into the air. The acceleration of the ball at its highest point is:
* [ ] $2g$, down
* [ ] $g$, up
* [ ] zero
* [x] $g$, down


6. A feather, initially at rest, is released in a vacuum $12m$ above the surface of the earth which of the follow statements is correct
* [ ] The maximum velocity of the feather is $9.8 m/s$
* [x] The acceleration of the feather remains constant during the fall
* [ ] The acceleration of the feather increases during the fall
* [ ] The acceleration of the feather decreases until terminal velocity is reached


7. The displacement time graph for a particle moving in a straight line is shown below, The accelerations of the particle during the intervals $OA$, $AB$, $BC$ and $CD$ are
* [x] $0$, $0$, $+$, $0$
* [ ] $+$, $0$, $-$, $+$
* [ ] $-$, $0$, $-$, $-$
* [ ] $-$, $0$, $+$, $0$


8. A baseball is hit straight up and is caught the catcher $2.0s$ later. The maximum height of the ball during this interval is:
* [x] $4.9m$
* [ ] $19.6m$
* [ ] $9.8m$
* [ ] $12.6m$
