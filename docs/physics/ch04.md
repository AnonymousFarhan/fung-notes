# Work & Energy

## Work
* If a force displaces or stops a moving body through a certain distance, the work is said to be done by the force on the body.
* Dot product of force and displacement is called work.

$$ W=\bar{F}.\bar{d} $$

$$ W=Fd\cos\theta $$

* SI unit of work is joule ($J$).
* In particle physics, work is measured in electron volt ($eV$).
* Dimensionally work is equivalent to $[ML^2T^2]$.

### Positive Work
* For $0<90^o$, work done is positive.
* Maximum positive work is done if $\theta=0^o$

#### Example
when an engine pulls a train.

### Zero work
Work will be zero
1. When $\theta=90^o$, (eg centripetal force and tension in pendulum string does not do any work)
2. When $F=0$
3. When $d=0$, (eg car is not moving while its engine is running.)

### Negative Work
* For $\theta>90^o$, work done is negative.
* Maximum negative work when $\theta=180^o$

#### Example
Work done by frictional forces

### Work from Graph
Graphically work can be obtained from force displacement graph The area under this graph is work done. Work is a scalar quantity.

* Work done by constant force
$$ \text{Area}=Fd=\text{work done} $$
