## Ideas of Modern Physics
* Light is an electromagnetic wave.
* Light consists of photons, each having energy $E=hf$.
* Speed of light is a universal constant in vacuum that is independent of motion of source and observers.
* Absorption and emission of electromagnetic waves takes place in the form of packets of energy called photons.
* True laws of physics retain their mathematical form in all inertial frame of reference.
* All the motions and rest are relative.
* There is noting like absolute rest or motion.
* Wave - particle duality.
* Reaction takes some time to replay, after action.
* Matter waves are association with moving particles.
* Einstein Equation's Energy mass relation is $E=mc^2$
* Photon can be splitted into a pair of electron and positron, process is called pair production.
* Positron and electron are annihilated to photon.
* Position, momentum, energy and time can't be measured accurately at same time.

## Relative Motion
* the concept of direction is purely relative.
* The experiments give same results in same frame of reference. In different frame, gives different results.

## Frame of Reference
* The coordinate system $x$, $y$ & $z$ axes from where observation is made is called frame of reference.
* **Inertial frame** is that which is either at rest or moving with uniform velocity.
* **Non inertial frame** is that which is in accelerated motion.
* Earth may be considered as an inertial frame of reference for motion on Earth.

!!! note
    The frame of reference in which the law of inertial is valid is called as inertial frame of reference.

## Theory of Relativity
* $$ m=\frac{m_o}{\sqrt{1-  \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} $$
* $$ l=l_o{\sqrt{1-  \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} $$ (Lorentz Contraction)
* $$ t=\frac{t_o}{\sqrt{1-  \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} $$
* $E=mc^2$
* All motion and rest are relative.
* No body moves with velocity greater than velocity of light.

!!! info
    At ordinary speed (as in common life) the results of special theory of relativity are

    * $m=m_o$
    * $l=l_o$
    * $t=t_o$

    that is why we don't observe any change in length, mass and time in ordinary life.

## NAVSTAR Navigation System
* Modern system of navigation called **NAVSTAR** use results of speed theory of relativity.
* The location and speed anywhere on the earth can be measured accurately up to 50m after 1hr flight and 20cms^^-1^^ velocity with use of NAVSTAR.

## Black Body Radiation
Black body is an ideal radiator and ideal absorber.

* The emissive or absorptive power is 1.
* Black body is very bad reflector.
* Black body emits electromagnetic waves.

### Intensity Distribution of Black Body
* **Lummer** and **Pringsheim** measured the intensity emitted energy of different wavelengths.
* Curve shows the characteristics depending upon temperature.
* At a given temperature, the energy is not uniformly distributed in the radiation spectrum.
* $\lambda_{max}\times T=\text{constant}=2.9\times10^-3mK$ so, $T\propto \frac{1}{\lambda}$
* the area under the curve shows the amount of energy ie emissive power.
* Energy (area of curve) is directly proportional to the fourth power of kelvin temperature ie Stephen-Boltzman law is $E\propto T^4$  $$ E=6t^4 $$ $$ \sigma=5.67\times 10^{-8} Wm^2 K^{-4}=\text{Stephen's constant} $$
* Shape of black body radiation curve is same and independent of material of the body.
* Classical attempts for explaination of black body radiations are given below:
    * **Wein's** Displacement law holds goof for shorter wavelength.
    * **Rayleigh Jean's** law holds good at longer wavelength.
    * **Plank's** quantum theory explains the black body radiations that absorption and emission of radiation takes place in the form of packets of energy called quanta ie $E=hf$. It holds good of all wavelengths.
    * Max Plank receive noble prize in 1918 in physics for discory of energy quanta.
