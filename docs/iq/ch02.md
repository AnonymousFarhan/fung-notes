hero: 02 - Directions

# Directions:
Questions from this category can give you hard time, but if you just follow the steps it will be an easy task.

**For example:** Ali moved 5km north, turned right and moved 4km straight, again turned right and moved 5km. What is his position with respect to the starting point?

**Solution:**

* **Step 1:** Draw the direction axis first of all. I.e. North, south, east and west.
* **Step 2:** Consider origin as the starting point.
* **Step 3:** Plot the distance moved as lines on the paper. i.e from origin a line towards north will show 5km, then a line on right 4km, then line on another right 5km. This is the final point.
* **Step 4:** Check the distance of this point from the origin. You can also be asked the direction of the final point.
