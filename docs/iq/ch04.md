# Finding the missing number
In these questions you have to detect which operation is performed on first number to get next number, or which operation is performed on first two numbers to get 3rd number.

You have to search for any such operation. It can be multiplication, division, addition, a combination of two operations. In these questions you need to use your brain. As you'll solve the questions you'll get to know about different possibilities/operations which can be performed.
