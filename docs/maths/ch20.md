## Cone & its Sections
* **Right Circular Cone:** The surface generated when one straight line that intersects another fixed straight line is rotated at an oblique angle. The lines are called generators of the cone.
* **Axis of the Cone:** The fixed line of the cone is called its axis.
* **Elements of the Cone:** The possible positions of the generating line in its rotation about the axis are its elements.
* **Vertex:** The common intersection point of all the cone's elements is called Vertex of cone.
* **Napes:** The two symmetrical parts of the generated surface on each side of the vertex are cone's Napes.
* **Conic Sections or Conics:** The curves that can be obtained by cutting a cone with a plane are called conic sections or conics.
* **Circle:** When the intersecting plane cuts completely across one napes at right angle to the axis of cone, the curve is called circle.
* **Point Circle:** If the intersection plane cuts across the vertex of a cone, the resulting curve is called point circle.
* **Parabola:** When the intersecting plane is parallel to an element, an passing through only one nape, the resulting curve is Parabola.
* **Ellipse:** When the intersecting plane cuts completely across one nape at an oblique angle to the axis, the curve is an ellipse.
* **Hyperbola:** When the intersecting plane cuts through both napes parallel to the axis of the cone the resulting curve is hyperbola.


## Circle
A set of points such that distance of each point fixed point called **center** remains constant. The constant distance is called **radius** of the circle.

### Equation

* **Standard Equation** <br> When center is $(h,k)$ & radius is $r$: $$ (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2 $$ <br> When center is $(0,0)$ & radius is $r$: $$ x^2 + y^2 = r^2 $$
* **Parametric Equation** \\[ x= r\cos\theta \\] \\[ y= r\sin\theta \\]
* If end points of the diameter of circle are $a(x_,y_1)$, $B(x_2,y_2)$ $$ (x-x_1)(x-x_2)+(y-y_1)(y-y_2)=0 $$
* **General Form** $$ x^2 + y^2 + 2gx+2fy+c=0 $$ The general form of circle equation have following properties:
    * It involves three constants $f,g,c$
    * It is a second degree equation in which coefficients of $x^2$ & $y^2$ are $1$
    * It does not involves $xy$ product
    * Center of the circle is $(-g,-f)$
    * Radius of circle is $\sqrt{g^2+f^2-c}$. If:
        * $r=\sqrt{g^2+f^2-c}>0$ circle is real circle
        * $r=\sqrt{g^2+f^2-c}=0$ circle is point circle
        * $r=\sqrt{g^2+f^2-c}<0$ circle is imaginary circle

* Any two tangents can be drawn to a circle from any point outside the circle.
* Let $P(x_1,y_1)$ be a point outside the circle $x^2+y^2+2gx+2fy+c=0$, then length of either tangents drawn to circle is : $$ \sqrt{x_1^2 +y_1^2 +2gx_1 +2fy_1 + c} $$
* The line $y=mx+c$ intersects the circle $x^2+y^2=a^2$ in at the most two points, the points are:
    * Real & distinct if $a^2(1+m^2)>c^2$
    * Real & coincident if $a^2(1+m^2)=c^2$ (also called **condition of tangency**)
