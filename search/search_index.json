Errors occurring due to the LC of the measuring instrument.\n\n\nRemedy\n\n\nSuch errors can be controlled experimentally while carefully monitoring the measurement process.\n\n\nUnassignable Error\n\n\nTo which we can't assign a cause because they do not follow a trend. So these errors are due to unknown causes.\n\n\nRemedy\n\n\nThese errors can't be controlled experimentally, but a statistical tool of taking average of several value is employed to minimize them.\n\n\nSignificant figures\n\n\nUncertainty in the measurements leads us to establish some standard to write the numerical value of a measurement, termed as significant figure.\n\n\n\n\n\"In any measurement, all the accurately known digits and the first doubtful digit are named as significant figures.\"\n\n\n\n\nRules of significant figures\n\n\nIn order to determine significant figures in a number we must follow the following rules:\n* All the non-zero digits are significant figures. \n \nFor Example:\n \n 3,456 has four significant figures.\n 12.3456 has six significant figures.\n* Zeros between non-zero digits are significant. \n \nFor Example:\n \n 2306 has four significant figures.\n 20,0894 has six significant figures.\n* Zeros locating the position of decimal in numbers o not significant. \n \nFor Example:\n \n In the 0.2224 and 0.000034, zeros are not significant\n* Final zeros to the right of the decimal point are significant. \n \nFor Example:\n \n 3.0000 has four significant zeros. \n 1002.00 has four significant zeros.\n* Zeros that locate decimal point in numbers greater than one are not significant.\nFor Example:\n3000 has only one significant figure.\n120000 has two significant figures.\n\n\n\n\nDo you know?\n\n\nGreater the significant figures in measurement the more accurate it is.\n\n\n\n\nAlgebra with Significant Figures\n\n\nDivision and Multiplication\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\frac{4.54\\times 2.324}{1.3365} = 7.89447063 =\\)\n an answer having maximum of three digits can he retained here \n\\(= 7.89\\)\n.\n\n\n\\(4.3458\\times 2.7 = 11.73366 =\\)\n an answer having maximum of two digits can he retained here \n\\(= 12\\)\n\n\nThe factor having the smallest number of significant figures is called least accurate factor, and product and quotient cannot have number of significant figures more than that in the least accurate factor\n\n\n\n\nAddition and Subtraction\n\n\nSearch for the least number of decimal places, counting the number of significant figures is not required. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\\(4.345+ 23.51= 27.855 =\\)\n an answer having maximum of two decimal places\n\n\\(= 27.86\\)\n\n\n\\(101.2401-1.0=100.2401=\\)\n an answer having maximum of one decimal place \n\\(=100.2\\)\n\n\n\\(101.2401-1=100.2401=\\)\n an answer having no decimal place \n\\(=100\\)\n\n\n\n\nRounding Off Data\n\n\nRule # 1:\n\n\nIf the digit to be dropped is greater than 5, then add 1 to the last digit to b, retained and drop all digits farther to the right.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\n\n\n\\(3.677\\)\n is rounded off to \n\\(3.68\\)\n if we need three significant figures in measurement.\n\n\n\\(3.677\\)\n is rounded off to \n\\(3.7\\)\n if we need two significant figures in measurement.\n\n\n\n\nRule # 2:\n\n\nIf the digit to be dropped is less than 5, then simply drop it without adding any digit number to the last digit.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\n\n\n\\(6.632\\)\n is rounded off to \n\\(6,63\\)\n if we need three significant figures in measurement.\n\n\n\\(6.632\\)\n is rounded off to \n\\(6.6\\)\n if we need two significant figures in measurement.\n\n\n\n\nRule # 3:\n\n\nIf the digit to be dropped is exactly 5 then:\n\n\nCase 1\n\n\nIf the digit to be retained is even, then just drop the \"5\".\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\n\n\n\\(6.65\\)\n is rounded off to \n\\(6.6\\)\n if we need two significant figures in measurement.\n\n\n\\(3.4665\\)\n is rounded off to \n\\(6.466\\)\n if we need four significant figures in measurement.\n\n\n\n\nCase 1\n\n\nIf the digit to be retained is odd, then add 1 to it.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\n\n\n\\(6.35\\)\n is rounded off to \n\\(6.4\\)\n if we need two significant figures in measurement.\n\n\n\\(3.4675\\)\n is rounded off to \n\\(6.468\\)\n if we need four significant figures in measurement:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nZero is an even number So, \n\\(3.05\\)\n is rounded off to \n\\(3.0\\)\n if we need two significant figures in measurement.\n\n\n\n\nPRECISION \n ACCURACY\n\n\nPrecision\n\n\nThe precision of a measurement is determined by the least count of the instrument or device.\n\n\nSmaller the least count of instrument, more precise is the measurement.\n\n\nAccuracy\n\n\nThe accuracy of a measurement depends upon the fractional or percentage uncertainty in the measurement.\n\n\nSmaller the percentage error, more accurate is the measurement. Maximum absolute uncertainty is equal to one least count of the measuring instrument.\n\n\nAssessment of Total Uncertainty in the Final Result\n\n\nTotal uncertainty in the final result can be determined by the following rules:\n\n\n\n\nIn case of addition and subtraction absolute uncertainties are to be added.\n\n\nIn case of multiplication and division fractional or percentage errors are to be added.\n\n\nFor power factor the power is multiplied with the percentage uncertainty.\n For example: In the equation \n\\(u= kx^a\\)\n, \n\\(a \\times \\text{percentage error in} x \\text{, where} k \\text{is constant of proportionality}\\)\n.\nUncertainty in the average value of many measurements of the same quantity is the mean of absolute differences of measurements form the average value.\n\n\nFor time measurement, uncertainty is obtained by dividing the least count of the timing device with the number of vibrations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you know?\n\n\nCounting more number of vibrations can reduce the uncertainty in the timing experiments.\n\n\n\n\nDimensions\n\n\nEach basic measurable physical quantity is represented in term of base quantities by a specific symbol for them written with in square brackets is called dimension.\n\n\nThe dimensions are helpful in:\n\n\n\n\nDeriving a possible formula\n\n\nChecking the homogeneity of a physical equation or formula.\n\n\n\n\nLimitations of Dimensional Analysis\n\n\n\n\nDimension analysis has no information on dimensionless constants.\n\n\nIf a quantity is dependent on trigonometric or exponential function, this method cannot be used.\n\n\nIn some cases, it is difficult to guess the factors while deriving the relation connecting two or more physical quantities.\n\n\nThis method cannot be used in an equation containing two or more variables with same dimensions.",

The magnetic field exerts force on the current carrying coil. This force produces a counter torque that opposes the rotational motion of coil. This effect is called back motor effect of generator.\n\n\nAccording to law of conservation of energy, the energy consumed by the load must come from the energy source used to drive turbines.\n\n\nThe larger the current drawn by the load, the greater is the counter torque produced.\n\n\n\n\nDC Motor\n\n\nA motor is a device which converts electrical energy into mechanical energy.\n* A generator running backward is called motor.\n* Principle of motor is that whenever a current carrying coil is placed in a magnetic field it experiences a couple of forces, which causes torque.\n\n\nBack EMF Effect in Motor\n\n\n\n\nThe self induced emf (\n\\(\\epsilon\\)\n) in a motor opposes the voltage \n\\(v\\)\n running the motor. Thus induced emf is called the back emf of motor.\n\n\nThe magnitude of back emf increases with the speed of motor.\n\n\n\\(V\\)\n \n \n\\(\\epsilon\\)\n are in opposite polarity.\n\n\n\n\nCurrent flowing in motor is: $$ I=\\frac{(V-\\epsilon)}{R} \\;\\; \\implies \\;\\; V=\\epsilon + IR $$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the motor speeds up, the back emf increases and the current become smaller and smaller. So current should be kept sufficient to provide torque.\n\n\n\n\nIf motor is overloaded, the back emf decreases and allow the motor to draw more current.\n\n\nIf motor is overloaded beyond its limits, the current could be so high that it may burn the motor coil.\n\n\n\n\nTransformer\n\n\nTransformer is an electromagnetic device used to step up or step down AC voltage or AC current, not DC.\n\n\n\n\nPrinciple of transformer is the \nmutual induction\n.\n\n\nCoil of transformer where input is applied is called primary coil while other where output is obtained is called secondary coil.\n\n\nCore consist of laminated punched sheets of sotf iron on which coil is wound.\n\n\nLamination of core is done to reduce \neddy current losses\n (eddy current is and induced current produced in a core).\n\n\nTransformer can not step up or step down the energy or power.\n\n\nTransformer consumes very little part of input power so it can kept running hours without considerable loss of power. $$ \\frac{V_s}{V_p} =\\frac{N_s}{N_p}= \\frac{I_p}{I_s} $$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\nTransformer is one of the static devices in the electrical appliances. So there is no loss of energy in friction. Hence they can have higher efficiencies. We can achieve up to 95% efficient transformer.\n\n\n\n\nEnergy Losses\n\n\n\n\nCopper Losses in winding:\n Due to resistance of the winding of primary and secondary coil, some electrical energy is always lost in form of heat energy.\n\n\nFlux Losses:\n The coupling of the primary and secondary is never perfect and whole of magnetic flux produced in the primary coil does not link the secondary coil. This results in some energy loss.\n\n\nIron losses in core:\n Iron losses are of two types:\n\n\nEddy Current Loss:\n Due to the periodically varying nature of AC supplied in primary, the flux associated with core changes and therefore, eddy currents are induced in it. Eddy currents induced in the core are undesirable as they heat the core and result in energy loss. To minimize the eddy current losses, core is laminated.\n\n\nHysterisis Loss:\n The alternating current flowing through the coils magnetized and demagnitizes the iron core again and again. therefore, during each cycle of magnetizatio, same energy lost due to hysterisis. To minimize  this loss we choose material of core of smaller hysterisis loss generally soft iron.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEfficiency of Transformer\n\n\nIdeal transformer efficiency is 100% or 1 but in actual tranformer output power is always less than inout power, so efficincy also always less than 100%. In general efficiency of transformer is very high and of the order of 90%.\n\n\n\n\nEfficiency is given by: $$ \\eta =\\frac{\\text{Output Power}}{\\text{Input Power}}\\times 100 $$\n\n\nIn terms of secondary and primary voltage and current $$ \\eta = \\frac{V_sI_s}{V_pI_p} $$\n\n\nAs, \n\\(\\text{Imput}=\\text{Output} + \\text{Losses}\\)\n so, $$ \\eta =\\frac{\\text{Output Power}}{\\text{Output Power} + \\text{Losses}} $$\n\n\n\n\nApplications\n\n\n\n\nThey are used in power distribution in a safe from power stations to the utility stations.\n\n\nThe principle of transmission is the that we reduce the value of current via increasing the transmission voltage so saving the cost of copper as less think wire can full fill the purpose due to small currents.\n\n\nTransformer also provide a degree of control of electricity distribution to a town.",

This work is stored as potential energy in the inductor as $$ U=\\frac{1}{2}LI^2 $$ Also  \\(L=\\mu_o n^2 Al\\)  $$ U=\\frac{1}{2}(\\mu_o n^2 Al)I^2 $$ As,  \\(B=\\mu_o nl\\)  Then, $$ U=\\frac{1}{2} B^2 \\frac{Al}{\\mu_o} $$ As,  \\(Al=\\text{Volume}\\)  Then energy density is $$ =\\frac{U}{Al}= \\frac{IB^2}{2\\mu_o} $$ OR $$ =\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{B^2}{\\mu_o} \\implies U\\propto B^2 $$    Inductor in an AC circuit always resists the abrupt change in current.     Info  The density of energy storage in an inductor is directly proportional to the square of the magnetic field strength provided all the other factors remains constant.",

An isolated single atom possesses a number of discrete energy levels that can be occupied by electrons of the atom. Generally the electrons exist in the ground state, when excited electrons can shift to higher energy levels. Usually only the valence electrons can participate in these excitations.\n\n\n\n\nAn energy state, which cannot be occupied, is forbidden gap.\n\n\nThe band formed by a series of energy levels containing, the valence electrons is known as \nvalence band\n. The valence band may be partially or completely filled up depending upon the nature of the crystal.\n\n\nThe next higher permitted band is called as the \nconduction band\n. This band may be empty or partially filled. In conduction band the electrons can move freely.\n\n\nMetals have positive temperature coefficient (\n\\(\\alpha_t\\)\n) of resistance while semiconductors have negative (\n\\(\\alpha_t\\)\n).\n\n\n\n\nElectrical Classification of Solids\n\n\nAll solids employed in electrical work may be classified into following three groups:\n\n\n\n\nConductors\n\n\nInsulators\n\n\nSemiconductors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConductors\n\n\nInsulators\n\n\nSemiconductors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of a conductor, there will be no forbidden energy gap. The conduction and valence energy bands overlap each other. Obviously, the electrons from the valence band can freely enter the conduction energy band.\n\n\nIn case of an insulators, the forbidden energy band is very wide and hence an electron cannot jump across, from the valence energy band to the conduction energy band. Only when a very large amount of energy is supplied, an electron may be able to jumps across the forbidden band. This explains why certain materials which are perfect insulators behave as conductors only at very high temperatures. In case of diamond, the forbidden energy gap is nearly \n\\(6eV\\)\n.\n\n\nIn the case of semiconductors, the forbidden energy band is comparatively small.

In this way an avalanche of electrons reach the wire and hence current pulse is produced.\n\n\nThe current pulse is detected across a resistance of \n\\(10^9\\Omega\\)\n.\n\n\n\n\nQuenching of Discharge\n\n\nPositive ions on reaching the metal tube pull out electrons. These electrons van excite the atoms, which on returning to ground state emit photons, which than ejects photoelectrons under photoelectric effect, To avoid photoelectrons, We do quenching.\n\n\nQuenching of discharge in G.M counter is attained by following two ways:\n\n\n\n\nManual quenching:\n by lowering voltage below critical value of discharge.\n\n\nSelf-quenching:\n by adding bromine gas into principal gas (neon) The mechanism is such that the 1:E of bromine is lower than neon, the ions of quenching gas reach the cathode before principal gas ions. When they reach near the cathode, they capture electron and become neutral molecules. Following neutralization, the excess energy of the quenching molecules is dissipated in dissociation of the molecules rather than in the release of electrons from the cathode.\n\n\nG.M counter can be used to study \n\\(\\beta\\)\n and \n\\(\\gamma\\)\n-rays effectively.\n\n\nIt can't detect \n\\(\\alpha\\)\n-particles.\n\n\n\n\nSolid State Detector\n\n\n\n\nSolid State detector is most sensitive detector capable of detecting three \n\\(\\alpha\\)\n, \n\\(\\beta\\)\n \n \n\\(\\gamma\\)\n-rays.\n\n\n\n\nConstruction\n\n\nSolid State detector mainly consists of reverse biased diode.\n\n\nProcedure\n\n\nWhen radiation falls on the diode, it causes the release of electrons, creating some sort of conduction path. The voltage caused due to flow of electrons is measured.\n\n\nAdvantages\n\n\n\n\nCompact size\n\n\nVery fast detector\n\n\nNo need of quenching\n\n\nPortable\n\n\nCan detected \n\\(\\alpha\\)\n, \n\\(\\beta\\)\n \n \n\\(\\gamma\\)\n-rays.\n\n\nLow energy utilization (requires \n\\(3eV - 4eV\\)\n of energy)\n\n\n\n\nNuclear Fission\n\n\n\n\nOtto Hahn and his co-workers discovered nuclear fission accidentally when they were attempting to prepare transuranic elements by bombarding \n\\(U_{92}^{238}\\)\n with \n\\(n_0^1\\)\n (slow).\n\n\nTransuranic elements are those elements that have atomic no. greater than that of uranium (the heaviest natural element) e.g. Np (Z=93), Pu (Z=94) etc.\n\n\nThere are 30 different ways by which nucleus can undergo fission accompanied by 2 to 5 neutrons (average is 2.5 neutrons).\n\n\nFission neutrons are ejected by daughter or fission fragment, not by parent nucleus.\n\n\nDuring fission, 99 percent neutrons are ejected in extremely short time and are called prompt neutrons, the remaining 1% are emitted a litter latter. They are called delayed neutrons.\n\n\nUnstable fission fragments, to become stable, eject delayed neutrons.\n\n\n\n\nIsotopes of Uranium\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOre\n\n\nPercentage\n\n\nHalf-life\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(_{92}U^{238}\\)\n\n\n\\(99.38\\)\n%\n\n\n\\(4.51\\times10^9\\)\n years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(_{92}U^{235}\\)\n\n\n\\(0.72\\)\n%\n\n\n\\(7.04\\times10^8\\)\n years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(_{92}U^{234}\\)\n\n\n\\(0.006\\)\n%\n\n\n\\(2.4\\times10^5\\)\n years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor fission of \n\\(U^{238}\\)\n \n\\(n^1\\)\n of energy \n\\(1MeV\\)\n is required while for \n\\(U^{235}\\)\n \n\\(n^1\\)\n energy \n\\(0.04eV\\)\n is required.\n\n\nTwo common fission reactions for uranium are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\\[ _0n^1+_{92}U^{235} \\longrightarrow _{86}Ba^{141} +_{36}Kr^{91}+ 3_0n^1+200MeV(Q) \\]\n\n\n\\[ _0n^1+_{92}U^{235} \\longrightarrow _{54}Xe^{140} +_{38}Sr^{94}+ 2_0n^1+200MeV \\]\n\n\nTypes of  Fission\n\n\n\n\nControlled fission chain reaction:\n In this reaction only one neutron, out of all the neutrons created in one fission reaction, becomes the cause of further fission reaction. It is the underlying principal of nuclear reactor.\n\n\nCritical mass:\n Such a mass of uranium in which one neutron, out of all the neutrons produced in one fission reaction, produces further fission is called critical mass.\n\n\n\n\nUncontrolled fission chain reaction:\n If the mass of uranium is much greater than the critical mass, then the chain reaction proceeds at a rapid speed and a huge explosion is produced.

Step 2:  Convert the alphabets you have to numbers. i.e. \nB A  T will be 2 1 20 \nAnd \nC  D Q will be 3 4 17    Step 3:  Find the difference between the two figures \n3 \u2013 2 = 1 \n4 \u2013 1 = 3 \n17 \u2013 20 = -3    Step 4:  Convert second word (PEN) into digits that will be 16 5 14    Step 5:  Add the difference you got above. \n16 + 1 = 17 \n5 + 3 = 8 \n14 + (-3)  = 11    Step 6:  Convert it back to alphabets.
